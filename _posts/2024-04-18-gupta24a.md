title: " Clustering Items From Adaptively Collected Inconsistent Feedback "
software: " https://github.com/IBM/aistats-24-inconsistent-feedback-clustering "
abstract: " We study clustering in a query-based model where the learner can repeatedly
  query an oracle to determine if two items belong to the same cluster. However, these
  queries are costly and the oracle’s responses are marred by inconsistency and noise.
  The learner’s goal is to adaptively make a small number of queries and return the
  correct clusters for \\emph{all} $n$ items with high confidence. We develop efficient
  algorithms for this problem using the sequential hypothesis testing framework. We
  derive high probability upper bounds on their sample complexity (the number of queries
  they make) and complement this analysis with an information-theoretic lower bound.
  In particular, we show that our algorithm for two clusters is nearly optimal when
  the oracle’s error probability is a constant. Our experiments verify these findings
  and highlight a few shortcomings of our algorithms. Namely, we show that their sample
  complexity deviates from the lower bound when the error probability of the oracle
  depends on $n$. We suggest an improvement based on a more efficient sequential hypothesis
  test and demonstrate it empirically. "
