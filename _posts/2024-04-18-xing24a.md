title: " Better Representations via Adversarial Training in Pre-Training: A Theoretical
  Perspective "
abstract: " Pre-training is known to generate universal representations for downstream
  tasks in large-scale deep learning such as large language models. Existing literature,
  e.g., Kim et al. (2020), empirically observe that the downstream tasks can inherit
  the adversarial robustness of the pre-trained model. We provide theoretical justifications
  for this robustness inheritance phenomenon. Our theoretical results reveal that
  feature purification plays an important role in connecting the adversarial robustness
  of the pre-trained model and the downstream tasks in two-layer neural networks.
  Specifically, we show that (i) with adversarial training, each hidden node tends
  to pick only one (or a few) feature; (ii) without adversarial training, the hidden
  nodes can be vulnerable to attacks. This observation is valid for both supervised
  pre-training and contrastive learning. With purified nodes, it turns out that clean
  training is enough to achieve adversarial robustness in downstream tasks. "
