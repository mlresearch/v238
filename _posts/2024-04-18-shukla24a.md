title: " DiffRed: Dimensionality reduction guided by stable rank "
software: " https://github.com/S3-Lab-IIT/DiffRed/tree/master "
abstract: " In this work, we propose a novel dimensionality reduction technique, \\textit{DiffRed},
  which first projects the data matrix, A, along first $k_1$ principal components
  and the residual matrix $A^{*}$ (left after subtracting its $k_1$-rank approximation)
  along $k_2$ Gaussian random vectors. We evaluate \\emph{M1}, the distortion of mean-squared
  pair-wise distance, and \\emph{Stress}, the normalized value of RMS of distortion
  of the pairwise distances. We rigorously prove that \\textit{DiffRed} achieves a
  general upper bound of $O\\left(\\sqrt{\\frac{1-p}{k_2}}\\right)$ on \\emph{Stress}
  and $O\\left(\\frac{1-p}{\\sqrt{k_2*\\rho(A^{*})}}\\right)$ on \\emph{M1} where
  $p$ is the fraction of variance explained by the first $k_1$ principal components
  and $\\rho(A^{*})$ is the \\textit{stable rank} of $A^{*}$. These bounds are tighter
  than the currently known results for Random maps. Our extensive experiments on a
  variety of real-world datasets demonstrate that \\textit{DiffRed} achieves near
  zero \\emph{M1} and much lower values of \\emph{Stress} as compared to the well-known
  dimensionality reduction techniques. In particular, \\textit{DiffRed} can map a
  6 million dimensional dataset to 10 dimensions with 54% lower \\emph{Stress} than
  PCA. "
