title: " A Bayesian Learning Algorithm for Unknown Zero-sum Stochastic Games with
  an Arbitrary Opponent "
abstract: " In this paper, we propose Posterior Sampling Reinforcement Learning for
  Zero-sum Stochastic Games (PSRL-ZSG), the first online learning algorithm that achieves
  Bayesian regret bound of $\\tilde\\mathcal{O}(HS\\sqrt{AT})$ in the infinite-horizon
  zero-sum stochastic games with average-reward criterion. Here $H$ is an upper bound
  on the span of the bias function, $S$ is the number of states, $A$ is the number
  of joint actions and $T$ is the horizon. We consider the online setting where the
  opponent can not be controlled and can take any arbitrary time-adaptive history-dependent
  strategy. Our regret bound improves on the best existing regret bound of $\\tilde\\mathcal{O}(\\sqrt[3]{DS^2AT^2})$
  by Wei et al., (2017) under the same assumption and matches the theoretical lower
  bound in $T$. "
