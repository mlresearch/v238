title: " The AL$\\ell_0$CORE Tensor Decomposition for Sparse Count Data "
software: " https://github.com/jhood3/allocore "
abstract: " This paper introduces AL$\\ell_0$CORE, a new form of probabilistic non-negative
  tensor decomposition. AL$\\ell_0$CORE is a Tucker decomposition that constrains
  the number of non-zero elements (i.e., the $\\ell_0$-norm) of the core tensor to
  be at most $Q$. While the user dictates the total budget $Q$, the locations and
  values of the non-zero elements are latent variables allocated across the core tensor
  during inference. AL$\\ell_0$CORE—i.e., allocated $\\ell_0$-constrained core—thus
  enjoys both the computational tractability of canonical polyadic (CP) decomposition
  and the qualitatively appealing latent structure of Tucker. In a suite of real-data
  experiments, we demonstrate that AL$\\ell_0$CORE typically requires only tiny fractions
  (e.g., 1%) of the core to achieve the same results as Tucker at a correspondingly
  small fraction of the cost. "
