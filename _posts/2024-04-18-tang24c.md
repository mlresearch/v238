title: " Stochastic Multi-Armed Bandits with Strongly Reward-Dependent Delays "
abstract: " There has been increasing interest in applying multi-armed bandits to
  adaptive designs in clinical trials. However, most literature assumes that a previous
  patient’s survival response of a treatment is known before the next patient is treated,
  which is unrealistic. The inability to account for response delays is cited frequently
  as one of the problems in using adaptive designs in clinical trials. More critically,
  the “delays” in observing the survival response are the same as the rewards rather
  than being external stochastic noise. We formalize this problem as a novel stochastic
  multi-armed bandit (MAB) problem with reward-dependent delays, where the delay at
  each round depends on the reward generated on the same round. For general reward/delay
  distributions with finite expectation, our proposed censored-UCB algorithm achieves
  near-optimal regret in terms of both problem-dependent and problem-independent bounds.
  With bounded or sub-Gaussian reward distributions, the upper bounds are optimal
  with a matching lower bound. Our theoretical results and the algorithms’ effectiveness
  are validated by empirical experiments. "
