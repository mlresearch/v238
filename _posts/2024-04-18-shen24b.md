title: " Efficient Variational Sequential Information Control "
software: " https://github.com/sjwjames/greedy_info_control "
abstract: " We develop a family of fast variational methods for sequential control
  in dynamic settings where an agent is incentivized to maximize information gain.
  We consider the case of optimal control in continuous nonlinear dynamical systems
  that prohibit exact evaluation of the mutual information (MI) reward. Our approach
  couples efficient message-passing inference with variational bounds on the MI objective
  under Gaussian projections. We also develop a Gaussian mixture approximation that
  enables exact MI evaluation under constraints on the component covariances. We validate
  our methodology in nonlinear systems with superior and faster control compared to
  standard particle-based methods. We show our approach improves the accuracy and
  efficiency of one-shot robotic learning with intrinsic MI rewards. Furthermore,
  we demonstrate that our method is applicable to a wider range of contexts, e.g.,
  the active information acquisition problem. "
