title: " A Neural Architecture Predictor based on GNN-Enhanced Transformer "
software: " https://github.com/GNET "
abstract: " Neural architecture performance predictor is an efficient approach for
  architecture estimation in Neural Architecture Search (NAS). However, existing predictors
  based on Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are deficient in modeling long-range interactions
  between operation nodes and prone to the problem of over-smoothing, which limits
  their ability to learn neural architecture representation. Furthermore, some Transformer-based
  predictors use simple position encodings to improve performance via self-attention
  mechanism, but they fail to fully exploit the subgraph structure information of
  the graph. To solve this problem, we propose a novel method to enhance the graph
  representation of neural architectures by combining GNNs and Transformer blocks.
  We evaluate the effectiveness of our predictor on NAS-Bench-101 and NAS-bench-201
  benchmarks, the discovered architecture on DARTS search space achieves an accuracy
  of 97.61% on CIFAR-10 dataset, which outperforms traditional position encoding methods
  such as adjacency and Laplacian matrices. The code of our work is available at \\url{https://github.com/GNET}. "
