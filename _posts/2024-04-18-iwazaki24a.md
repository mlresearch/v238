title: " Risk Seeking Bayesian Optimization under Uncertainty for Obtaining Extremum "
abstract: " Real-world black-box optimization tasks often focus on obtaining the best
  reward, which includes an intrinsic random quantity from uncontrollable environmental
  factors. For this problem, we formulate a novel risk-seeking optimization problem
  whose aim is to obtain the best possible reward within a fixed budget under uncontrollable
  factors. We consider two settings: (1) environmental model setting for the case
  that we can observe uncontrollable environmental variables that affect the observation
  as the input of a target function, and (2) heteroscedastic model setting for the
  case that any uncontrollable variables cannot be observed. We propose a novel Bayesian
  optimization method called kernel explore-then-commit (kernel-ETC) and provide the
  regret upper bound for both settings. We demonstrate the effectiveness of kernel-ETC
  through several numerical experiments, including the hyperparameter tuning task
  and the simulation function derived from polymer synthesis real data. "
