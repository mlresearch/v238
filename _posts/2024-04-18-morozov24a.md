title: " Differentiable Rendering with Reparameterized Volume Sampling "
software: " https://github.com/GreatDrake/reparameterized-volume-sampling "
abstract: " In view synthesis, a neural radiance field approximates underlying density
  and radiance fields based on a sparse set of scene pictures. To generate a pixel
  of a novel view, it marches a ray through the pixel and computes a weighted sum
  of radiance emitted from a dense set of ray points. This rendering algorithm is
  fully differentiable and facilitates gradient-based optimization of the fields.
  However, in practice, only a tiny opaque portion of the ray contributes most of
  the radiance to the sum. We propose a simple end-to-end differentiable sampling
  algorithm based on inverse transform sampling. It generates samples according to
  the probability distribution induced by the density field and picks non-transparent
  points on the ray. We utilize the algorithm in two ways. First, we propose a novel
  rendering approach based on Monte Carlo estimates. This approach allows for evaluating
  and optimizing a neural radiance field with just a few radiance field calls per
  ray. Second, we use the sampling algorithm to modify the hierarchical scheme proposed
  in the original NeRF work. We show that our modification improves reconstruction
  quality of hierarchical models, at the same time simplifying the training procedure
  by removing the need for auxiliary proposal network losses. "
