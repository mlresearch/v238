  Trees "

abstract: " Tabular data is hard to acquire and is subject to missing values. This
  paper introduces a novel approach for generating and imputing mixed-type (continuous
  and categorical) tabular data utilizing score-based diffusion and conditional flow
  matching. In contrast to prior methods that rely on neural networks to learn the
  score function or the vector field, we adopt XGBoost, a widely used Gradient-Boosted
  Tree (GBT) technique. To test our method, we build one of the most extensive benchmarks
  for tabular data generation and imputation, containing 27 diverse datasets and 9
  metrics. Through empirical evaluation across the benchmark, we demonstrate that
  our approach outperforms deep-learning generation methods in data generation tasks
  and remains competitive in data imputation. Notably, it can be trained in parallel
  using CPUs without requiring a GPU. Our Python and R code is available at \\url{https://github.com/SamsungSAILMontreal/ForestDiffusion}. "
