title: " On the Nyström Approximation for Preconditioning in Kernel Machines "
abstract: " Kernel methods are a popular class of nonlinear predictive models in machine
  learning. Scalable algorithms for learning kernel models need to be iterative in
  nature, but convergence can be slow due to poor conditioning. Spectral preconditioning
  is an important tool to speed-up the convergence of such iterative algorithms for
  training kernel models. However computing and storing a spectral preconditioner
  can be expensive which can lead to large computational and storage overheads, precluding
  the application of kernel methods to problems with large datasets. A Nystrom approximation
  of the spectral preconditioner is often cheaper to compute and store, and has demonstrated
  success in practical applications. In this paper we analyze the trade-offs of using
  such an approximated preconditioner. Specifically, we show that a sample of logarithmic
  size (as a function of the size of the dataset) enables the Nyström-based approximated
  preconditioner to accelerate gradient descent nearly as well as the exact preconditioner,
  while also reducing the computational and storage overheads. "
