title: " On the Effect of Key Factors in Spurious Correlation: A theoretical Perspective "
software: " https://github.com/yipei-wang/spurious_feature_mahalanobis "
abstract: " Spurious correlations arise when irrelevant patterns in input data are
  mistakenly associated with labels, compromising the generalizability of machine
  learning models. While these models may be confident during the training stage,
  they often falter in real-world testing scenarios due to the shift of these misleading
  correlations. Current solutions to this problem typically involve altering the correlations
  or regularizing latent representations. However, while these methods show promise
  in experiments, a rigorous theoretical understanding of their effectiveness and
  the underlying factors of spurious correlations is lacking. In this work, we provide
  a comprehensive theoretical analysis, supported by empirical evidence, to understand
  the intricacies of spurious correlations. Drawing on our proposed theorems, we investigate
  the behaviors of classifiers when confronted with spurious features, and present
  our findings on how various factors influence these correlations and their impact
  on model performances, including the Mahalanobis distance of groups, and training/testing
  spurious correlation ratios. Additionally, by aligning empirical outcomes with our
  theoretical discoveries, we highlight the feasibility of assessing the degree of
  separability of intertwined real-world features. This research paves the way for
  a nuanced comprehension of spurious correlations, laying a solid theoretical groundwork
  that promises to steer future endeavors toward crafting more potent mitigation techniques. "
