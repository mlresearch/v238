title: " P-tensors: a General Framework for Higher Order Message Passing in Subgraph
  Neural Networks "
abstract: " Several recent papers have proposed increasing the expressiveness of graph
  neural networks by exploiting subgraphs or other topological structures. In parallel,
  researchers have investigated higher order permutation equivariant networks. In
  this paper we tie these two threads together by providing a general framework for
  higher order permutation equivariant message passing in subgraph neural networks.
  Our exposition hinges on so-called $P$-tensors, which provide a simple way to define
  the most general form of permutation equivariant message passing in this category
  of networks. We show that this paradigm can achieve state-of-the-art performance
  on benchmark molecular datasets. "
