title: " Importance Matching Lemma for Lossy Compression with Side Information "
software: " https://github.com/truongbuu/IML_Experiment "
abstract: " We propose two extensions to existing importance sampling based methods
  for lossy compression. First, we introduce an importance sampling based compression
  scheme that is a variant of ordered random coding (Theis and Ahmed, 2022) and is
  amenable to direct evaluation of the achievable compression rate for a finite number
  of samples. Our second and major contribution is the \\emph{importance matching
  lemma}, which is a finite proposal counterpart of the recently introduced {Poisson
  matching lemma} (Li and Anantharam, 2021). By integrating with deep learning, we
  provide a new coding scheme for distributed lossy compression with side information
  at the decoder. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme through
  experiments involving synthetic Gaussian sources, distributed image compression
  with MNIST and vertical federated learning with CIFAR-10. "
