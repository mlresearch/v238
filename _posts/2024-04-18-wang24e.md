title: " Invariant Aggregator for Defending against Federated Backdoor Attacks "
software: " https://github.com/Xiaoyang-Wang/InvariantAggregator "
abstract: " Federated learning enables training high-utility models across several
  clients without directly sharing their private data. As a downside, the federated
  setting makes the model vulnerable to various adversarial attacks in the presence
  of malicious clients. Despite the theoretical and empirical success in defending
  against attacks that aim to degrade models’ utility, defense against backdoor attacks
  that increase model accuracy on backdoor samples exclusively without hurting the
  utility on other samples remains challenging. To this end, we first analyze the
  failure modes of existing defenses over a flat loss landscape, which is common for
  well-designed neural networks such as Resnet (He et al., 2015) but is often overlooked
  by previous works. Then, we propose an invariant aggregator that redirects the aggregated
  update to invariant directions that are generally useful via selectively masking
  out the update elements that favor few and possibly malicious clients. Theoretical
  results suggest that our approach provably mitigates backdoor attacks and remains
  effective over flat loss landscapes. Empirical results on three datasets with different
  modalities and varying numbers of clients further demonstrate that our approach
  mitigates a broad class of backdoor attacks with a negligible cost on the model
  utility. "
