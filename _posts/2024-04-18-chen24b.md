title: " An Efficient Stochastic Algorithm for Decentralized Nonconvex-Strongly-Concave
  Minimax Optimization "
software: " https://github.com/TrueNobility303/DREAM "
abstract: " This paper studies the stochastic nonconvex-strongly-concave minimax optimization
  over a multi-agent network. We propose an efficient algorithm, called Decentralized
  Recursive gradient descEnt Ascent Method (DREAM), which achieves the best-known
  theoretical guarantee for finding the $\\epsilon$-stationary points. Concretely,
  it requires $\\mathcal{O}(\\min (\\kappa^3\\epsilon^{-3},\\kappa^2 \\sqrt{N} \\epsilon^{-2}
  ))$ stochastic first-order oracle (SFO) calls and $\\tilde \\mathcal O(\\kappa^2
  \\epsilon^{-2})$ communication rounds, where $\\kappa$ is the condition number and
  $N$ is the total number of individual functions. Our numerical experiments also
  validate the superiority of DREAM over previous methods. "
