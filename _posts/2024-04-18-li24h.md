title: " Optimal Exploration is no harder than Thompson Sampling "
software: " https://github.com/zhaoqil/PureExpThompsonSampling/tree/aistats_2024_code "
abstract: " Given a set of arms $\\mathcal{Z}\\subset \\mathbb{R}^d$ and an unknown
  parameter vector $\\theta_\\ast\\in\\mathbb{R}^d$, the pure exploration linear bandits
  problem aims to return $\\arg\\max_{z\\in \\mathcal{Z}} z^{\\top}\\theta_{\\ast}$,
  with high probability through noisy measurements of $x^{\\top}\\theta_{\\ast}$ with
  $x\\in \\mathcal{X}\\subset \\mathbb{R}^d$. Existing (asymptotically) optimal methods
  require either a) potentially costly projections for each arm $z\\in \\mathcal{Z}$
  or b) explicitly maintaining a subset of $\\mathcal{Z}$ under consideration at each
  time. This complexity is at odds with the popular and simple Thompson Sampling algorithm
  for regret minimization, which just requires access to a posterior sampling and
  argmax oracle, and does not need to enumerate $\\mathcal{Z}$ at any point. Unfortunately,
  Thompson sampling is known to be sub-optimal for pure exploration. In this work,
  we pose a natural question: is there an algorithm that can explore optimally and
  only needs the same computational primitives as Thompson Sampling? We answer the
  question in the affirmative. We provide an algorithm that leverages only sampling
  and argmax oracles and achieves an exponential convergence rate, with the exponent
  equal to the exponent of the optimal fixed allocation asymptotically. In addition,
  we show that our algorithm can be easily implemented and performs as well empirically
  as existing asymptotically optimal methods. "
