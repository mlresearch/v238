title: " Parameter-Agnostic Optimization under Relaxed Smoothness "
software: " https://github.com/fhueb/parameter-agnostic-lzlo "
abstract: " Tuning hyperparameters, such as the stepsize, presents a major challenge
  of training machine learning models. To address this challenge, numerous adaptive
  optimization algorithms have been developed that achieve near-optimal complexities,
  even when stepsizes are independent of problem-specific parameters, provided that
  the loss function is $L$-smooth. However, as the assumption is relaxed to the more
  realistic $(L_0, L_1)$-smoothness, all existing convergence results still necessitate
  tuning of the stepsize. In this study, we demonstrate that Normalized Stochastic
  Gradient Descent with Momentum (NSGD-M) can achieve a (nearly) rate-optimal complexity
  without prior knowledge of any problem parameter, though this comes at the cost
  of introducing an exponential term dependent on $L_1$ in the complexity. We further
  establish that this exponential term is inevitable to such schemes by introducing
  a theoretical framework of lower bounds tailored explicitly for parameter-agnostic
  algorithms. Interestingly, in deterministic settings, the exponential factor can
  be neutralized by employing Gradient Descent with a Backtracking Line Search. To
  the best of our knowledge, these findings represent the first parameter-agnostic
  convergence results under the generalized smoothness condition. Our empirical experiments
  further confirm our theoretical insights. "
