title: " Failures and Successes of Cross-Validation for Early-Stopped Gradient Descent "
abstract: " We analyze the statistical properties of generalized cross-validation
  (GCV) and leave-one-out cross-validation (LOOCV) applied to early-stopped gradient
  descent (GD) in high-dimensional least squares regression. We prove that GCV is
  generically inconsistent as an estimator of the prediction risk of early-stopped
  GD, even for a well-specified linear model with isotropic features. In contrast,
  we show that LOOCV converges uniformly along the GD trajectory to the prediction
  risk. Our theory requires only mild assumptions on the data distribution and does
  not require the underlying regression function to be linear. Furthermore, by leveraging
  the individual LOOCV errors, we construct consistent estimators for the entire prediction
  error distribution along the GD trajectory and consistent estimators for a wide
  class of error functionals. This in particular enables the construction of pathwise
  prediction intervals based on GD iterates that have asymptotically correct nominal
  coverage conditional on the training data. "
