title: " Horizon-Free and Instance-Dependent Regret Bounds for Reinforcement Learning
  with General Function Approximation "
software: " https://github.com/jyhuang78/UCRL-WVTR "
abstract: " To tackle long planning horizon problems in reinforcement learning with
  general function approximation, we propose the first algorithm, termed as UCRL-WVTR,
  that achieves both \\emph{horizon-free} and \\emph{instance-dependent}, since it
  eliminates the polynomial dependency on the planning horizon. The derived regret
  bound is deemed \\emph{sharp}, as it matches the minimax lower bound when specialized
  to linear mixture MDPs up to logarithmic factors. Furthermore, UCRL-WVTR is \\emph{computationally
  efficient} with access to a regression oracle. The achievement of such a horizon-free,
  instance-dependent, and sharp regret bound hinges upon (i) novel algorithm designs:
  weighted value-targeted regression and a high-order moment estimator in the context
  of general function approximation; and (ii) fine-grained analysis: a novel concentration
  bound of weighted non-linear least squares and a refined analysis which leads to
  the tight instance-dependent bound. We also conduct comprehensive experiments to
  corroborate our theoretical findings. "
