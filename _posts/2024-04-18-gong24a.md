title: " Testing Generated Distributions in GANs to Penalize Mode Collapse "
software: " https://github.com/yxgong0/Stacked_Text "
abstract: " Mode collapse remains the primary unresolved challenge within generative
  adversarial networks (GANs). In this work, we introduce an innovative approach that
  supplements the discriminator by additionally enforcing the similarity between the
  generated and real distributions. We implement a one-sample test on the generated
  samples and employ the resulting test statistic to penalize deviations from the
  real distribution. Our method encompasses a practical strategy to estimate distributions,
  compute the test statistic via a differentiable function, and seamlessly incorporate
  test outcomes into the training objective. Crucially, our approach preserves the
  convergence and theoretical integrity of GANs, as the introduced constraint represents
  a requisite condition for optimizing the generator training objective. Notably,
  our method circumvents reliance on regularization or network modules, enhancing
  compatibility and facilitating its practical application. Empirical evaluations
  on diverse public datasets validate the efficacy of our proposed approach. "
