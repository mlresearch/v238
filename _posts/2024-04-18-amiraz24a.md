title: " Recovery Guarantees for Distributed-OMP "
software: " https://github.com/ChenAttias/Distributed-OMP "
abstract: " We study distributed schemes for high-dimensional sparse linear regression,
  based on orthogonal matching pursuit (OMP). Such schemes are particularly suited
  for settings where a central fusion center is connected to end machines, that have
  both computation and communication limitations. We prove that under suitable assumptions,
  distributed-OMP schemes recover the support of the regression vector with communication
  per machine linear in its sparsity and logarithmic in the dimension. Remarkably,
  this holds even at low signal-to-noise-ratios, where individual machines are unable
  to detect the support. Our simulations show that distributed-OMP schemes are competitive
  with more computationally intensive methods, and in some cases even outperform them. "
