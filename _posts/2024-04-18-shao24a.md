title: " Nonparametric Automatic Differentiation Variational Inference with Spline
  Approximation "
software: " https://github.com/TianshuFeng/SADVI_AISTATS2024 "
abstract: " Automatic Differentiation Variational Inference (ADVI) is efficient in
  learning probabilistic models. Classic ADVI relies on the parametric approach to
  approximate the posterior. In this paper, we develop a spline-based nonparametric
  approximation approach that enables flexible posterior approximation for distributions
  with complicated structures, such as skewness, multimodality, and bounded support.
  Compared with widely-used nonparametric variational inference methods, the proposed
  method is easy to implement and adaptive to various data structures. By adopting
  the spline approximation, we derive a lower bound of the importance weighted autoencoder
  and establish the asymptotic consistency. Experiments demonstrate the efficiency
  of the proposed method in approximating complex posterior distributions and improving
  the performance of generative models with incomplete data. "
