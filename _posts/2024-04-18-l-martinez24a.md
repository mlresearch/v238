  Interpolating Classifiers "

abstract: " Group distributional robustness optimization methods (GDRO) learn models
  that guarantee performance across a broad set of demographics. GDRO is often framed
  as a minimax game where an adversary proposes data distributions under which the
  model performs poorly; importance weights are used to mimic the adversarial distribution
  on finite samples. Prior work has show that applying GDRO with interpolating classifiers
  requires strong regularization to generalize to unseen data. Moreover, these classifiers
  are not responsive to importance weights in the asymptotic training regime. In this
  work we propose Bi-level GDRO, a provably convergent formulation that decouples
  the adversary’s and model learner’s objective and improves generalization guarantees.
  To address non-responsiveness of importance weights, we combine Bi-level GDRO with
  a learner that optimizes a temperature-scaled loss that can provably trade off performance
  between demographics, even on interpolating classifiers. We experimentally demonstrate
  the effectiveness of our proposed method on learning minimax classifiers on a variety
  of datasets. Code is available at github.com/MartinBertran/BiLevelGDRO. "
