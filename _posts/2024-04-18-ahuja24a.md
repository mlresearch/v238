title: " Multi-Domain Causal Representation Learning via Weak Distributional Invariances "
software: " https://github.com/facebookresearch/MD-CRL "
abstract: " Causal representation learning has emerged as the center of action in
  causal machine learning research. In particular, multi-domain datasets present a
  natural opportunity for showcasing the advantages of causal representation learning
  over standard unsupervised representation learning. While recent works have taken
  crucial steps towards learning causal representations, they often lack applicability
  to multi-domain datasets due to over-simplifying assumptions about the data; e.g.
  each domain comes from a different single-node perfect intervention. In this work,
  we relax these assumptions and capitalize on the following observation: there often
  exists a subset of latents whose certain distributional properties (e.g., support,
  variance) remain stable across domains; this property holds when, for example, each
  domain comes from a multi-node imperfect intervention. Leveraging this observation,
  we show that autoencoders that incorporate such invariances can provably identify
  the stable set of latents from the rest across different settings. "
