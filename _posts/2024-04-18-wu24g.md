title: " Unsupervised Change Point Detection in Multivariate Time Series "
abstract: " We consider the challenging problem of unsupervised change point detection
  in multivariate time series when the number of change points is unknown. Our method
  eliminates the user’s need for careful parameter tuning, enhancing its practicality
  and usability. Our approach identifies time series segments with similar empirically
  estimated distributions, coupled with a novel greedy algorithm guided by the minimum
  description length principle. We provide theoretical guarantees and, through experiments
  on synthetic and real-world data, provide empirical evidence for its improved performance
  in identifying meaningful change points in practical settings. "
