title: Minimax optimal density estimation using a shallow generative model with a
  one-dimensional latent variable
abstract: A deep generative model yields an implicit estimator for the unknown distribution
  or density function of the observation. This paper investigates some statistical
  properties of the implicit density estimator pursued by VAE-type methods from a
  nonparametric density estimation framework. More specifically, we obtain convergence
  rates of the VAE-type density estimator under the assumption that the underlying
  true density function belongs to a locally Holder class. Remarkably, a near minimax
  optimal rate with respect to the Hellinger metric can be achieved by the simplest
  network architecture, a shallow generative model with a one-dimensional latent variable.
