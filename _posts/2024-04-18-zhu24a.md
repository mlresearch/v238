title: " Robust Offline Reinforcement Learning with Heavy-Tailed Rewards "
software: " https://github.com/Mamba413/ROOM "
abstract: " This paper endeavors to augment the robustness of offline reinforcement
  learning (RL) in scenarios laden with heavy-tailed rewards, a prevalent circumstance
  in real-world applications. We propose two algorithmic frameworks, ROAM and ROOM,
  for robust off-policy evaluation and offline policy optimization (OPO), respectively.
  Central to our frameworks is the strategic incorporation of the median-of-means
  method with offline RL, enabling straightforward uncertainty estimation for the
  value function estimator. This not only adheres to the principle of pessimism in
  OPO but also adeptly manages heavy-tailed rewards. Theoretical results and extensive
  experiments demonstrate that our two frameworks outperform existing methods on the
  logged dataset exhibits heavy-tailed reward distributions. The implementation of
  the proposal is available at \\url{https://github.com/Mamba413/ROOM}. "
