title: " Pathwise Explanation of ReLU Neural Networks "
software: " https://github.com/Jo-won/PathwiseExplanation "
abstract: ' Neural networks have demonstrated a wide range of successes, but their
  “black box" nature raises concerns about transparency and reliability. Previous
  research on ReLU networks has sought to unwrap these networks into linear models
  based on activation states of all hidden units. In this paper, we introduce a novel
  approach that considers subsets of the hidden units involved in the decision making
  path. This pathwise explanation provides a clearer and more consistent understanding
  of the relationship between the input and the decision-making process. Our method
  also offers flexibility in adjusting the range of explanations within the input,
  i.e., from an overall attribution input to particular components within the input.
  Furthermore, it allows for the decomposition of explanations for a given input for
  more detailed explanations. Our experiments demonstrate that the proposed method
  outperforms existing methods both quantitatively and qualitatively. '
