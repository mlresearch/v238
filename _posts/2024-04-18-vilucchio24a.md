title: " Asymptotic Characterisation of the Performance of Robust Linear Regression
  in the Presence of Outliers "
software: " https://github.com/IdePHICS/RobustRegression "
abstract: " We study robust linear regression in high-dimension, when both the dimension
  $d$ and the number of data points $n$ diverge with a fixed ratio $\\alpha=n/d$,
  and study a data model that includes outliers. We provide exact asymptotics for
  the performances of the empirical risk minimisation (ERM) using $\\ell_2$-regularised
  $\\ell_2$, $\\ell_1$, and Huber losses, which are the standard approach to such
  problems. We focus on two metrics for the performance: the generalisation error
  to similar datasets with outliers, and the estimation error of the original, unpolluted
  function. Our results are compared with the information theoretic Bayes-optimal
  estimation bound. For the generalization error, we find that optimally-regularised
  ERM is asymptotically consistent in the large sample complexity limit if one perform
  a simple calibration, and compute the rates of convergence. For the estimation error
  however, we show that due to a norm calibration mismatch, the consistency of the
  estimator requires an oracle estimate of the optimal norm, or the presence of a
  cross-validation set not corrupted by the outliers. We examine in detail how performance
  depends on the loss function and on the degree of outlier corruption in the training
  set and identify a region of parameters where the optimal performance of the Huber
  loss is identical to that of the $\\ell_2$ loss, offering insights into the use
  cases of different loss functions. "
