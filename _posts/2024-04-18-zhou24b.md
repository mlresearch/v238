title: " Reward-Relevance-Filtered Linear Offline Reinforcement Learning "
software: " https://github.com/angelamzhou/reward-filtered-offline-reinforcement-learning "
abstract: " This paper studies offline reinforcement learning with linear function
  approximation in a setting with decision-theoretic, but not estimation sparsity.
  The structural restrictions of the data-generating process presume that the transitions
  factor into a sparse component that affects the reward and could affect additional
  exogenous dynamics that do not affect the reward. Although the minimally sufficient
  adjustment set for estimation of full-state transition properties depends on the
  whole state, the optimal policy and therefore state-action value function depends
  only on the sparse component: we call this causal/decision-theoretic sparsity. We
  develop a method for reward-filtering the estimation of the state-action value function
  to the sparse component by a modification of thresholded lasso in least-squares
  policy evaluation. We provide theoretical guarantees for our reward-filtered linear
  fitted-Q-iteration, with sample complexity depending only on the size of the sparse
  component. "
