software: " https://github.com/benbatten/TightVerificationOfProbabilisticRobustnessInBNNs "
abstract: " We introduce two algorithms for computing tight guarantees on the probabilistic
  robustness of Bayesian Neural Networks (BNNs). Computing robustness guarantees for
  BNNs is a significantly more challenging task than verifying the robustness of standard
  Neural Networks (NNs) because it requires searching the parameters’ space for safe
  weights. Moreover, tight and complete approaches for the verification of standard
  NNs, such as those based on Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP), cannot be directly
  used for the verification of BNNs because of the polynomial terms resulting from
  the consecutive multiplication of variables encoding the weights. Our algorithms
  efficiently and effectively search the parameters’ space for safe weights by using
  iterative expansion and the network’s gradient and can be used with any verification
  algorithm of choice for BNNs. In addition to proving that our algorithms compute
  tighter bounds than the SoA, we also evaluate our algorithms against the SoA on
  standard benchmarks, such as MNIST and CIFAR10, showing that our algorithms compute
  bounds up to 40% tighter than the SoA. "
