title: " An Online Bootstrap for Time Series "
software: " https://github.com/nicolaipalm/online-bootstrap-implementation "
abstract: " Resampling methods such as the bootstrap have proven invaluable in the
  field of machine learning. However, the applicability of traditional bootstrap methods
  is limited when dealing with large streams of dependent data, such as time series
  or spatially correlated observations. In this paper, we propose a novel bootstrap
  method that is designed to account for data dependencies and can be executed online,
  making it particularly suitable for real-time applications. This method is based
  on an autoregressive sequence of increasingly dependent resampling weights. We prove
  the theoretical validity of the proposed bootstrap scheme under general conditions.
  We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through extensive simulations and
  show that it provides reliable uncertainty quantification even in the presence of
  complex data dependencies. Our work bridges the gap between classical resampling
  techniques and the demands of modern data analysis, providing a valuable tool for
  researchers and practitioners in dynamic, data-rich environments. "
