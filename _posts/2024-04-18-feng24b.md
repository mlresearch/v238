title: " Monitoring machine learning-based risk prediction algorithms in the presence
  of performativity "

abstract: " Performance monitoring of machine learning (ML)-based risk prediction
  models in healthcare is complicated by the issue of performativity: when an algorithm
  predicts a patient to be at high risk for an adverse event, clinicians are more
  likely to administer prophylactic treatment and alter the very target that the algorithm
  aims to predict. A simple approach is to ignore performativity and monitor only
  the untreated patients, whose outcomes remain unaltered. In general, ignoring performativity
  may inflate Type I error because (i) untreated patients disproportionally represent
  those with low predicted risk, and (ii) changes in the clinician’s trust in the
  ML algorithm and the algorithm itself can induce complex dependencies that violate
  standard assumptions. Nevertheless, we show that valid inference is still possible
  when monitoring \\textit{conditional} rather than marginal performance measures
  under either the assumption of conditional exchangeability or time-constant selection
  bias. Finally, performativity can vary over time and induce nonstationarity in the
  data, which presents challenges for monitoring. To this end, we introduce a new
  score-based cumulative sum (CUSUM) monitoring procedure with dynamic control limits.
  Through extensive simulation studies, we study applications of the score-based CUSUM
  and how it is affected by various factors, including the efficiency of model updating
  procedures and the level of clinician trust. Finally, we apply the procedure to
  detect calibration decay of a risk model during the COVID-19 pandemic. "
