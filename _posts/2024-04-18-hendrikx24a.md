title: " The Relative Gaussian Mechanism and its Application to Private Gradient Descent "
software: " https://github.com/HadrienHx/RGM "
abstract: " The Gaussian Mechanism (GM), which consists in adding Gaussian noise to
  a vector-valued query before releasing it, is a standard privacy protection mechanism.
  In particular, given that the query respects some L2 sensitivity property (the L2
  distance between outputs on any two neighboring inputs is bounded), GM guarantees
  Rényi Differential Privacy (RDP). Unfortunately, precisely bounding the L2 sensitivity
  can be hard, thus leading to loose privacy bounds. In this work, we consider a Relative
  L2 sensitivity assumption, in which the bound on the distance between two query
  outputs may also depend on their norm. Leveraging this assumption, we introduce
  the Relative Gaussian Mechanism (RGM), in which the variance of the noise depends
  on the norm of the output. We prove tight bounds on the RDP parameters under relative
  L2 sensitivity, and characterize the privacy loss incurred by using output-dependent
  noise. In particular, we show that RGM naturally adapts to a latent variable that
  would control the norm of the output. Finally, we instantiate our framework to show
  tight guarantees for Private Gradient Descent, a problem that naturally fits our
  relative L2 sensitivity assumption. "
