title: " Imposing Fairness Constraints in Synthetic Data Generation "
abstract: " In several real-world applications (e.g., online advertising, item recommendations,
  etc.) it may not be possible to release and share the real dataset due to privacy
  concerns. As a result, synthetic data generation (SDG) has emerged as a promising
  solution for data sharing. While the main goal of private SDG is to create a dataset
  that preserves the privacy of individuals contributing to the dataset, the use of
  synthetic data also creates an opportunity to improve fairness. Since there often
  exist historical biases in the datasets, using the original real data for training
  can lead to an unfair model. Using synthetic data, we can attempt to remove such
  biases from the dataset before releasing the data. In this work, we formalize the
  definition of fairness in synthetic data generation and provide a general framework
  to achieve fairness. Then we consider two notions of counterfactual fairness and
  information filtering fairness and show how our framework can be used for these
  definitions. "
