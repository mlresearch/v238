title: " Double InfoGAN for Contrastive Analysis "
software: " https://github.com/Florence-C/Double_InfoGAN "
abstract: " Contrastive Analysis (CA) deals with the discovery of what is common and
  what is distinctive of a target domain compared to a background one. This is of
  great interest in many applications, such as medical imaging. Current state-of-the-art
  (SOTA) methods are latent variable models based on VAE (CA-VAEs). However, they
  all either ignore important constraints or they don’t enforce fundamental assumptions.
  This may lead to sub-optimal solutions where distinctive factors are mistaken for
  common ones (or viceversa). Furthermore, the generated images have a rather poor
  quality, typical of VAEs, decreasing their interpretability and usefulness. Here,
  we propose Double InfoGAN, the first GAN based method for CA that leverages the
  high-quality synthesis of GAN and the separation power of InfoGAN. Experimental
  results on four visual datasets, from simple synthetic examples to complex medical
  images, show that the proposed method outperforms SOTA CA-VAEs in terms of latent
  separation and image quality. Datasets and code are available online. "
