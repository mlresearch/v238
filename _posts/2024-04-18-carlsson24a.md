title: " Pure Exploration in Bandits with Linear Constraints "
software: " https://github.com/e-carlsson/constraint-pure-exploration "
abstract: " We address the problem of identifying the optimal policy with a fixed
  confidence level in a multi-armed bandit setup, when \\emph{the arms are subject
  to linear constraints}. Unlike the standard best-arm identification problem which
  is well studied, the optimal policy in this case may not be deterministic and could
  mix between several arms. This changes the geometry of the problem which we characterize
  via an information-theoretic lower bound. We introduce two asymptotically optimal
  algorithms for this setting, one based on the Track-and-Stop method and the other
  based on a game-theoretic approach. Both these algorithms try to track an optimal
  allocation based on the lower bound and computed by a weighted projection onto the
  boundary of a normal cone. Finally, we provide empirical results that validate our
  bounds and visualize how constraints change the hardness of the problem. "
