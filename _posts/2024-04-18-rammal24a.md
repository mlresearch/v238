title: " Communication Compression for Byzantine Robust Learning: New Efficient Algorithms
  and Improved Rates "
abstract: " Byzantine robustness is an essential feature of algorithms for certain
  distributed optimization problems, typically encountered in collaborative/federated
  learning. These problems are usually huge-scale, implying that communication compression
  is also imperative for their resolution. These factors have spurred recent algorithmic
  and theoretical developments in the literature of Byzantine-robust learning with
  compression. In this paper, we contribute to this research area in two main directions.
  First, we propose a new Byzantine-robust method with compression – Byz-DASHA-PAGE
  – and prove that the new method has better convergence rate (for non-convex and
  Polyak-Lojasiewicz smooth optimization problems), smaller neighborhood size in the
  heterogeneous case, and tolerates more Byzantine workers under over-parametrization
  than the previous method with SOTA theoretical convergence guarantees (Byz-VR-MARINA).
  Secondly, we develop the first Byzantine-robust method with communication compression
  and error feedback – Byz-EF21 – along with its bi-directional compression version
  – Byz-EF21-BC – and derive the convergence rates for these methods for non-convex
  and Polyak-Lojasiewicz smooth case. We test the proposed methods and illustrate
  our theoretical findings in the numerical experiments. "
