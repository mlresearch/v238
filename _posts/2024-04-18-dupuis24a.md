title: " The Solution Path of SLOPE "
software: " https://github.com/x-dupuis/slope-path "
abstract: " The SLOPE estimator has the particularity of having null components (sparsity)
  and components that are equal in absolute value (clustering). The number of clusters
  depends on the regularization parameter of the estimator. This parameter can be
  chosen as a trade-off between interpretability (with a small number of clusters)
  and accuracy (with a small mean squared error or a small prediction error). Finding
  such a compromise requires to compute the solution path, that is the function mapping
  the regularization parameter to the estimator. We provide in this article an algorithm
  to compute the solution path of SLOPE and show how it can be used to adjust the
  regularization parameter. "
