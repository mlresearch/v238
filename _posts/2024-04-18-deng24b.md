title: " On the Generalization Ability of Unsupervised Pretraining "
abstract: " Recent advances in unsupervised learning have shown that unsupervised
  pre-training, followed by fine-tuning, can improve model generalization. However,
  a rigorous understanding of how the representation function learned on an unlabeled
  dataset affects the generalization of the fine-tuned model is lacking. Existing
  theoretical research does not adequately account for the heterogeneity of the distribution
  and tasks in pre-training and fine-tuning stage. To bridge this gap, this paper
  introduces a novel theoretical framework that illuminates the critical factor influencing
  the transferability of knowledge acquired during unsupervised pre-training to the
  subsequent fine-tuning phase, ultimately affecting the generalization capabilities
  of the fine-tuned model on downstream tasks. We apply our theoretical framework
  to analyze generalization bound of two distinct scenarios: Context Encoder pre-training
  with deep neural networks and Masked Autoencoder pre-training with deep transformers,
  followed by fine-tuning on a binary classification task. Finally, inspired by our
  findings, we propose a novel regularization method during pre-training to further
  enhances the generalization of fine-tuned model. Overall, our results contribute
  to a better understanding of unsupervised pre-training and fine-tuning paradigm,
  and can shed light on the design of more effective pre-training algorithms. "
