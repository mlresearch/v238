title: " Online Calibrated and Conformal Prediction Improves Bayesian Optimization "
abstract: " Accurate uncertainty estimates are important in sequential model-based
  decision-making tasks such as Bayesian optimization. However, these estimates can
  be imperfect if the data violates assumptions made by the model (e.g., Gaussianity).
  This paper studies which uncertainties are needed in model-based decision-making
  and in Bayesian optimization, and argues that uncertainties can benefit from calibration—i.e.,
  an 80% predictive interval should contain the true outcome 80% of the time. Maintaining
  calibration, however, can be challenging when the data is non-stationary and depends
  on our actions. We propose using simple algorithms based on online learning to provably
  maintain calibration on non-i.i.d. data, and we show how to integrate these algorithms
  in Bayesian optimization with minimal overhead. Empirically, we find that calibrated
  Bayesian optimization converges to better optima in fewer steps, and we demonstrate
  improved performance on standard benchmark functions and hyperparameter optimization
  tasks. "
