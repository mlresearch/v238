title: " Multitask Online Learning: Listen to the Neighborhood Buzz "
abstract: " We study multitask online learning in a setting where agents can only
  exchange information with their neighbors on an arbitrary communication network.
  We introduce MT-CO\\textsubscript{2}OL, a decentralized algorithm for this setting
  whose regret depends on the interplay between the task similarities and the network
  structure. Our analysis shows that the regret of MT-CO\\textsubscript{2}OL is never
  worse (up to constants) than the bound obtained when agents do not share information.
  On the other hand, our bounds significantly improve when neighboring agents operate
  on similar tasks. In addition, we prove that our algorithm can be made differentially
  private with a negligible impact on the regret. Finally, we provide experimental
  support for our theory. "
