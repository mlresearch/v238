title: " Deep anytime-valid hypothesis testing "
software: " https://github.com/tpandeva/deep-anytime-testing "
abstract: " We propose a general framework for constructing powerful, sequential hypothesis
  tests for a large class of nonparametric testing problems. The null hypothesis for
  these problems is defined in an abstract form using the action of two known operators
  on the data distribution. This abstraction allows for a unified treatment of several
  classical tasks, such as two-sample testing, independence testing, and conditional-independence
  testing, as well as modern problems, such as testing for adversarial robustness
  of machine learning (ML) models. Our proposed framework has the following advantages
  over classical batch tests: 1) it continuously monitors online data streams and
  efficiently aggregates evidence against the null, 2) it provides tight control over
  the type I error without the need for multiple testing correction, 3) it adapts
  the sample size requirement to the unknown hardness of the problem. We develop a
  principled approach of leveraging the representation capability of ML models within
  the testing-by-betting framework, a game-theoretic approach for designing sequential
  tests. Empirical results on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that tests
  instantiated using our general framework are competitive against specialized baselines
  on several tasks. "
