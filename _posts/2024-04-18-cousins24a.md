title: " To Pool or Not To Pool: Analyzing the Regularizing Effects of Group-Fair
  Training on Shared Models "
abstract: " In fair machine learning, one source of performance disparities between
  groups is overfitting to groups with relatively few training samples. We derive
  group-specific bounds on the generalization error of welfare-centric fair machine
  learning that benefit from the larger sample size of the majority group. We do this
  by considering group-specific Rademacher averages over a restricted hypothesis class,
  which contains the family of models likely to perform well with respect to a fair
  learning objective (e.g., a power-mean). Our simulations demonstrate these bounds
  improve over a naïve method, as expected by theory, with particularly significant
  improvement for smaller group sizes. "
