title: " Transductive conformal inference with adaptive scores "
software: " https://github.com/ulyssegazin/TransductiveAdaptive_CP "
abstract: " Conformal inference is a fundamental and versatile tool that provides
  distribution-free guarantees for many machine learning tasks. We consider the transductive
  setting, where decisions are made on a test sample of $m$ new points, giving rise
  to $m$ conformal $p$-values. While classical results only concern their marginal
  distribution, we show that their joint distribution follows a Pólya urn model, and
  establish a concentration inequality for their empirical distribution function.
  The results hold for arbitrary exchangeable scores, including adaptive ones that
  can use the covariates of the test${+}$calibration samples at training stage for
  increased accuracy. We demonstrate the usefulness of these theoretical results through
  uniform, in-probability guarantees for two machine learning tasks of current interest:
  interval prediction for transductive transfer learning and novelty detection based
  on two-class classification. "
