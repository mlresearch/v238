title: " The Galerkin method beats Graph-Based Approaches for Spectral Algorithms "
software: " https://github.com/VivienCabannes/laplacian "
abstract: " Historically, the machine learning community has derived spectral decompositions
  from graph-based approaches. We break with this approach and prove the statistical
  and computational superiority of the Galerkin method, which consists in restricting
  the study to a small set of test functions. In particular, we introduce implementation
  tricks to deal with differential operators in large dimensions with structured kernels.
  Finally, we extend on the core principles beyond our approach to apply them to non-linear
  spaces of functions, such as the ones parameterized by deep neural networks, through
  loss-based optimization procedures. "
