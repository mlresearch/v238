title: " SIFU: Sequential Informed Federated Unlearning for Efficient and Provable
  Client Unlearning in Federated Optimization "
software: " https://github.com/Accenture/Labs-Federated-Learning/tree/SIFU "
abstract: " Machine Unlearning (MU) is an increasingly important topic in machine
  learning safety, aiming at removing the contribution of a given data point from
  a training procedure. Federated Unlearning (FU) consists in extending MU to unlearn
  a given client’s contribution from a federated training routine. While several FU
  methods have been proposed, we currently lack a general approach providing formal
  unlearning guarantees to the FedAvg routine, while ensuring scalability and generalization
  beyond the convex assumption on the clients’ loss functions. We aim at filling this
  gap by proposing SIFU (Sequential Informed Federated Unlearning), a new FU method
  applying to both convex and non-convex optimization regimes. SIFU naturally applies
  to FedAvg without additional computational cost for the clients and provides formal
  guarantees on the quality of the unlearning task. We provide a theoretical analysis
  of the unlearning properties of SIFU, and practically demonstrate its effectiveness
  as compared to a panel of unlearning methods from the state-of-the-art. "
