abstract: " Symbolic regression has excelled in uncovering equations from physics,
  chemistry, biology, and related disciplines. However, its effectiveness becomes
  less certain when applied to experimental data lacking inherent closed-form expressions.
  Empirically derived relationships, such as entire stress-strain curves, may defy
  concise closed-form representation, compelling us to explore more adaptive modeling
  approaches that balance flexibility with interpretability. In our pursuit, we turn
  to Generalized Additive Models (GAMs), a widely used class of models known for their
  versatility across various domains. Although GAMs can capture non-linear relationships
  between variables and targets, they cannot capture intricate feature interactions.
  In this work, we investigate both of these challenges and propose a novel class
  of models, Shape Arithmetic Expressions (SHAREs), that fuses GAM’s flexible shape
  functions with the complex feature interactions found in mathematical expressions.
  SHAREs also provide a unifying framework for both of these approaches. We also design
  a set of rules for constructing SHAREs that guarantee transparency of the found
  expressions beyond the standard constraints based on the model’s size. "
