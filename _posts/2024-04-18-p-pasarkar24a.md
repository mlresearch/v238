  For Science And Machine Learning "

abstract: " Measuring diversity accurately is important for many scientific fields,
  including machine learning (ML), ecology, and chemistry. The Vendi Score was introduced
  as a generic similarity-based diversity metric that extends the Hill number of order
  $q=1$ by leveraging ideas from quantum statistical mechanics. Contrary to many diversity
  metrics in ecology, the Vendi Score accounts for similarity and does not require
  knowledge of the prevalence of the categories in the collection to be evaluated
  for diversity. However, the Vendi Score treats each item in a given collection with
  a level of sensitivity proportional to the item’s prevalence. This is undesirable
  in settings where there is a significant imbalance in item prevalence. In this paper,
  we extend the other Hill numbers using similarity to provide flexibility in allocating
  sensitivity to rare or common items. This leads to a family of diversity metrics–Vendi
  scores with different levels of sensitivity controlled by the order $q$–that can
  be used in a variety of applications. We study the properties of the scores in a
  synthetic controlled setting where the ground truth diversity is known. We then
  test the utility of the Vendi scores in improving molecular simulations via Vendi
  Sampling. Finally, we use the scores to better understand the behavior of image
  generative models in terms of memorization, duplication, diversity, and sample quality. "
