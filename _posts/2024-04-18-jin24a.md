title: " Subsampling Error in Stochastic Gradient Langevin Diffusions "
abstract: " The Stochastic Gradient Langevin Dynamics (SGLD) are popularly used to
  approximate Bayesian posterior distributions in statistical learning procedures
  with large-scale data. As opposed to many usual Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)
  algorithms, SGLD is not stationary with respect to the posterior distribution; two
  sources of error appear: The first error is introduced by an Euler–Maruyama discretisation
  of a Langevin diffusion process, the second error comes from the data subsampling
  that enables its use in large-scale data settings. In this work, we consider an
  idealised version of SGLD to analyse the method’s pure subsampling error that we
  then see as a best-case error for diffusion-based subsampling MCMC methods. Indeed,
  we introduce and study the Stochastic Gradient Langevin Diffusion (SGLDiff), a continuous-time
  Markov process that follows the Langevin diffusion corresponding to a data subset
  and switches this data subset after exponential waiting times. There, we show the
  exponential ergodicity of SLGDiff and that the Wasserstein distance between the
  posterior and the limiting distribution of SGLDiff is bounded above by a fractional
  power of the mean waiting time. We bring our results into context with other analyses
  of SGLD. "
