title: " LP-based Construction of DC Decompositions for Efficient Inference of Markov
  Random Fields "
software: " https://github.com/chaimurti/DC-Handelman "
abstract: " The success of the convex-concave procedure (CCCP), a widely used technique
  for non-convex optimization, crucially depends on finding a decomposition of the
  objective function as a difference of convex functions (dcds). Despite the widespread
  applicability of CCCP, finding such dcds has attracted little attention in machine
  learning. For graphical models with polynomial potentials, existing methods for
  finding dcds require solving a Sum-of-Squares (SOS) program, which is often prohibitively
  expensive. In this work, we leverage tools from algebraic geometry certifying the
  positivity of polynomials, to derive LP-based constructions of dcds of polynomials
  which are particularly suited for graphical model inference. Our experiments demonstrate
  that using our LP-based technique constructs dcds for polynomial potentials of Markov
  random fields significantly faster compared to SOS-based approaches used in previous
  works. "
