abstract: " Current causal inference approaches for estimating conditional average
  treatment effects (CATEs) often prioritize accuracy. However, in resource constrained
  settings, decision makers may only need a ranking of individuals based on their
  estimated CATE. In these scenarios, exact CATE estimation may be an unnecessarily
  challenging task, particularly when the underlying function is difficult to learn.
  In this work, we study the relationship between CATE estimation and optimizing for
  CATE ranking, demonstrating that optimizing for ranking may be more appropriate
  than optimizing for accuracy in certain settings. Guided by our analysis, we propose
  an approach to directly optimize for rankings of individuals to inform treatment
  assignment that aims to maximize benefit. Our tree-based approach maximizes the
  expected benefit of the treatment assignment using a novel splitting criteria. In
  an empirical case-study across synthetic datasets, our approach leads to better
  treatment assignments compared to CATE estimation methods as measured by expected
  total benefit. By providing a practical and efficient approach to learning a CATE
  ranking, this work offers an important step towards bridging the gap between CATE
  estimation techniques and their downstream applications. "
