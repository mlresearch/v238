title: " Maximum entropy GFlowNets with soft Q-learning "
software: " https://github.com/recursionpharma/gflownet "
abstract: " Generative Flow Networks (GFNs) have emerged as a powerful tool for sampling
  discrete objects from unnormalized distributions, offering a scalable alternative
  to Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods. While GFNs draw inspiration from maximum
  entropy reinforcement learning (RL), the connection between the two has largely
  been unclear and seemingly applicable only in specific cases. This paper addresses
  the connection by constructing an appropriate reward function, thereby establishing
  an exact relationship between GFNs and maximum entropy RL. This construction allows
  us to introduce maximum entropy GFNs, which achieve the maximum entropy attainable
  by GFNs without constraints on the state space, in contrast to GFNs with uniform
  backward policy. "
