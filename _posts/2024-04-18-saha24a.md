title: " Faster Convergence with MultiWay Preferences "
software: " https://github.com/aadirupa/FasterConvergence-with-Multiway-Preferences "
abstract: " We address the problem of convex optimization with preference feedback,
  where the goal is to minimize a convex function given a weaker form of comparison
  queries. Each query consists of two points and the dueling feedback returns a (noisy)
  single-bit binary comparison of the function values of the two queried points. Here
  we consider the sign-function-based comparison feedback model and analyze the convergence
  rates with batched and multiway (argmin of a set queried points) comparisons. Our
  main goal is to understand the improved convergence rates owing to parallelization
  in sign-feedback-based optimization problems. Our work is the first to study the
  problem of convex optimization with multiway preferences and analyze the optimal
  convergence rates. Our first contribution lies in designing efficient algorithms
  with a convergence rate of $\\smash{\\widetilde O}(\\frac{d}{\\min\\{m,d\\} \\epsilon})$
  for $m$-batched preference feedback where the learner can query $m$-pairs in parallel.
  We next study a $m$-multiway comparison (‘battling’) feedback, where the learner
  can get to see the argmin feedback of $m$-subset of queried points and show a convergence
  rate of $\\smash{\\widetilde O}(\\frac{d}{ \\min\\{\\log m,d\\}\\epsilon })$. We
  show further improved convergence rates with an additional assumption of strong
  convexity. Finally, we also study the convergence lower bounds for batched preferences
  and multiway feedback optimization showing the optimality of our convergence rates
  w.r.t. $m$. "
