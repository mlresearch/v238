title: " A White-Box False Positive Adversarial Attack Method on Contrastive Loss
  Based Offline Handwritten Signature Verification Models "
software: " https://github.com/ZhongliangGuo/FP-attack "
abstract: " In this paper, we tackle the challenge of white-box false positive adversarial
  attacks on contrastive loss based offline handwritten signature verification models.
  We propose a novel attack method that treats the attack as a style transfer between
  closely related but distinct writing styles. To guide the generation of deceptive
  images, we introduce two new loss functions that enhance the attack success rate
  by perturbing the Euclidean distance between the embedding vectors of the original
  and synthesized samples, while ensuring minimal perturbations by reducing the difference
  between the generated image and the original image. Our method demonstrates state-of-the-art
  performance in white-box attacks on contrastive loss based offline handwritten signature
  verification models, as evidenced by our experiments. The key contributions of this
  paper include a novel false positive attack method, two new loss functions, effective
  style transfer in handwriting styles, and superior performance in white-box false
  positive attacks compared to other white-box attack methods. "
