title: " Provable local learning rule by expert aggregation for a Hawkes network "
software: " https://github.com/SophieJaffard/HAN "
abstract: " We propose a simple network of Hawkes processes as a cognitive model capable
  of learning to classify objects. Our learning algorithm, named HAN for Hawkes Aggregation
  of Neurons, is based on a local synaptic learning rule based on spiking probabilities
  at each output node. We were able to use local regret bounds to prove mathematically
  that the network is able to learn on average and even asymptotically under more
  restrictive assumptions. "
