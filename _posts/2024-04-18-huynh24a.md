title: " DAGnosis: Localized Identification of Data Inconsistencies using Structures "
software: " https://github.com/nicolashuynh/DAGNOSIS "
abstract: " Identification and appropriate handling of inconsistencies in data at
  deployment time is crucial to reliably use machine learning models. While recent
  data-centric methods are able to identify such inconsistencies with respect to the
  training set, they suffer from two key limitations: (1) suboptimality in settings
  where features exhibit statistical independencies, due to their usage of compressive
  representations and (2) lack of localization to pin-point why a sample might be
  flagged as inconsistent, which is important to guide future data collection. We
  solve these two fundamental limitations using directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) to
  encode the training set’s features probability distribution and independencies as
  a structure. Our method, called DAGnosis, leverages these structural interactions
  to bring valuable and insightful data-centric conclusions. DAGnosis unlocks the
  localization of the causes of inconsistencies on a DAG, an aspect overlooked by
  previous approaches. Moreover, we show empirically that leveraging these interactions
  (1) leads to more accurate conclusions in detecting inconsistencies, as well as
  (2) provides more detailed insights into why some samples are flagged. "
