abstract: " Graph neural networks (GNNs) are powerful tools on graph data. However,
  their predictions are mis-calibrated and lack interpretability, limiting their adoption
  in critical applications. To address this issue, we propose a new uncertainty-aware
  and interpretable graph classification model that combines graph functional neural
  process and graph generative model. The core of our method is to assume a set of
  latent rationales which can be mapped to a probabilistic embedding space; the predictive
  distribution of the classifier is conditioned on such rationale embeddings by learning
  a stochastic correlation matrix. The graph generator serves to decode the graph
  structure of the rationales from the embedding space for model interpretability.
  For efficient model training, we adopt an alternating optimization procedure which
  mimics the well known Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm. The proposed method
  is general and can be applied to any existing GNN architecture. Extensive experiments
  on five graph classification datasets demonstrate that our framework outperforms
  state-of-the-art methods in both uncertainty quantification and GNN interpretability.
  We also conduct case studies to show that the decoded rationale structure can provide
  meaningful explanations. "
