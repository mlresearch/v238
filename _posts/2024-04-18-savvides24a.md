title: " Error bounds for any regression model using Gaussian processes with gradient
  information "
software: " https://github.com/edahelsinki/gpbound "
abstract: " We provide an upper bound for the expected quadratic loss on new data
  for any regression model. We derive the bound by modelling the underlying function
  by a Gaussian process (GP). Instead of a single kernel or family of kernels of the
  same form, we consider all GPs with translation-invariant and continuously twice
  differentiable kernels having a bounded signal variance and prior covariance of
  the gradient. To obtain a bound for the expected posterior loss, we present bounds
  for the posterior variance and squared bias. The squared bias bound depends on the
  regression model used, which can be arbitrary and not based on GPs. The bounds scale
  well with data size, in contrast to computing the GP posterior by a Cholesky factorisation
  of a large matrix. More importantly, our bounds do not require strong prior knowledge
  as we do not specify the exact kernel form. We validate our theoretical findings
  by numerical experiments and show that the bounds have applications in uncertainty
  estimation and concept drift detection. "
