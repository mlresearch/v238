title: " Solving Attention Kernel Regression Problem via Pre-conditioner "
abstract: " Attention mechanism is the key to large language models, and attention
  matrix serves as an algorithmic and computational bottleneck for such a scheme.
  In this paper, we define two problems, motivated by designing fast algorithms for
  \\emph{proxy} of attention matrix and solving regressions against them. Given an
  input matrix $A\\in \\mathbb{R}^{n\\times d}$ with $n\\gg d$ and a response vector
  $b$, we first consider the matrix exponential of the matrix $A^\\top A$ as a proxy,
  and we in turn design algorithms for two types of regression problems: $\\min_{x\\in
  \\mathbb{R}^d}\\|(A^\\top A)^jx-b\\|_2$ and $\\min_{x\\in \\mathbb{R}^d}\\|A(A^\\top
  A)^jx-b\\|_2$ for any positive integer $j$. Studying algorithms for these regressions
  is essential, as matrix exponential can be approximated term-by-term via these smaller
  problems. The second proxy is applying exponential entrywise to the Gram matrix,
  denoted by $\\exp(AA^\\top)$ and solving the regression $\\min_{x\\in \\mathbb{R}^n}\\|\\exp(AA^\\top)x-b
  \\|_2$. We call this problem the \\emph{attention kernel regression} problem, as
  the matrix $\\exp(AA^\\top)$ could be viewed as a kernel function with respect to
  $A$. We design fast algorithms for these regression problems, based on sketching
  and preconditioning. We hope these efforts will provide an alternative perspective
  of studying efficient approximation of attention matrices. "
