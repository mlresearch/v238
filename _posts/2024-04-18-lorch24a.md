title: " Causal Modeling with Stationary Diffusions "
software: " https://github.com/larslorch/stadion "
abstract: " We develop a novel approach towards causal inference. Rather than structural
  equations over a causal graph, we learn stochastic differential equations (SDEs)
  whose stationary densities model a system’s behavior under interventions. These
  stationary diffusion models do not require the formalism of causal graphs, let alone
  the common assumption of acyclicity. We show that in several cases, they generalize
  to unseen interventions on their variables, often better than classical approaches.
  Our inference method is based on a new theoretical result that expresses a stationarity
  condition on the diffusion’s generator in a reproducing kernel Hilbert space. The
  resulting kernel deviation from stationarity (KDS) is an objective function of independent
  interest. "
