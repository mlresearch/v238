title: " Model-Based Best Arm Identification for Decreasing Bandits "
software: " https://github.com/takemori135/model-based-BAI-for-decreasing-bandits "
abstract: " We study the problem of reliably identifying the best (lowest loss) arm
  in a stochastic multi-armed bandit when the expected loss of each arm is monotone
  decreasing as a function of its pull count. This models, for instance, scenarios
  where each arm itself represents an optimization algorithm for finding the minimizer
  of a common function, and there is a limited time available to test the algorithms
  before committing to one of them. We assume that the decreasing expected loss of
  each arm depends on the number of its pulls as a (inverse) polynomial with unknown
  coefficients. We propose two fixed-budget best arm identification algorithms – one
  for the case of sparse polynomial decay models and the other for general polynomial
  models – along with bounds on the identification error probability. We also derive
  algorithm-independent lower bounds on the error probability. These bounds are seen
  to be factored into the product of the usual problem complexity and the model complexity
  that only depends on the parameters of the model. This indicates that our methods
  can identify the best arm even when the budget is smaller. We conduct empirical
  studies of our algorithms to complement our theoretical findings. "
