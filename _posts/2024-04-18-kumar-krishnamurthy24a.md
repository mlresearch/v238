title: " Towards Costless Model Selection in Contextual Bandits: A Bias-Variance Perspective "
abstract: " Model selection in supervised learning provides costless guarantees as
  if the model that best balances bias and variance was known a priori. We study the
  feasibility of similar guarantees for cumulative regret minimization in the stochastic
  contextual bandit setting. Recent work [Marinov and Zimmert, 2021] identifies instances
  where no algorithm can guarantee costless regret bounds. Nevertheless, we identify
  benign conditions where costless model selection is feasible: gradually increasing
  class complexity, and diminishing marginal returns for best-in-class policy value
  with increasing class complexity. Our algorithm is based on a novel misspecification
  test, and our analysis demonstrates the benefits of using model selection for reward
  estimation. Unlike prior work on model selection in contextual bandits, our algorithm
  carefully adapts to the evolving bias-variance trade-off as more data is collected.
  In particular, our algorithm and analysis go beyond adapting to the complexity of
  the simplest realizable class and instead adapt to the complexity of the simplest
  class whose estimation variance dominates the bias. For short horizons, this provides
  improved regret guarantees that depend on the complexity of simpler classes. "
