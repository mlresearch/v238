abstract: " High-resolution simulations, such as the ICOsahedral Non-hydrostatic Large-Eddy
  Model (ICON-LEM), provide valuable insights into the complex interactions among
  aerosols, clouds, and precipitation, which are the major contributors to climate
  change uncertainty. However, due to their exorbitant computational costs, they can
  only be employed for a limited period and geographical area. To address this, we
  propose a more cost-effective method powered by an emerging machine learning approach
  to better understand the intricate dynamics of the climate system. Our approach
  involves active learning techniques by leveraging high-resolution climate simulation
  as an oracle that is queried based on an abundant amount of unlabeled data drawn
  from satellite observations. In particular, we aim to predict autoconversion rates,
  a crucial step in precipitation formation, while significantly reducing the need
  for a large number of labeled instances. In this study, we present novel methods:
  custom fusion query strategies for labeling instances – weight fusion (WiFi) and
  merge fusion (MeFi) – along with active feature selection based on SHAP. These methods
  are designed to tackle real-world challenges – in this case, climate change, with
  a specific focus on the prediction of autoconversion rates – due to their simplicity
  and practicality in application. "
