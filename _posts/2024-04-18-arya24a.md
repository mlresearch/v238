software: " https://github.com/Shivvrat/Advanced-Inference-Schemes-for-DDNs "
abstract: " We present a unified framework called deep dependency networks (DDNs)
  that combines dependency networks and deep learning architectures for multi-label
  classification, with a particular emphasis on image and video data. The primary
  advantage of dependency networks is their ease of training, in contrast to other
  probabilistic graphical models like Markov networks. In particular, when combined
  with deep learning architectures, they provide an intuitive, easy-to-use loss function
  for multi-label classification. A drawback of DDNs compared to Markov networks is
  their lack of advanced inference schemes, necessitating the use of Gibbs sampling.
  To address this challenge, we propose novel inference schemes based on local search
  and integer linear programming for computing the most likely assignment to the labels
  given observations. We evaluate our novel methods on three video datasets (Charades,
  TACoS, Wetlab) and three image datasets (MS-COCO, PASCAL VOC, NUS-WIDE), comparing
  their performance with (a) basic neural architectures and (b) neural architectures
  combined with Markov networks equipped with advanced inference and learning techniques.
  Our results demonstrate the superiority of our new DDN methods over the two competing
  approaches. "
