title: " Simulation-Based Stacking "
software: " https://github.com/bregaldo/simulation_based_stacking "
abstract: " Simulation-based inference has been popular for amortized Bayesian computation.
  It is typical to have more than one posterior approximation, from different inference
  algorithms, different architectures, or simply the randomness of initialization
  and stochastic gradients. With a consistency guarantee, we present a general posterior
  stacking framework to make use of all available approximations. Our stacking method
  is able to combine densities, simulation draws, confidence intervals, and moments,
  and address the overall precision, calibration, coverage, and bias of the posterior
  approximation at the same time. We illustrate our method on several benchmark simulations
  and a challenging cosmological inference task. "
