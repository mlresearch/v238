title: " Analysis of Privacy Leakage in Federated Large Language Models "
software: " https://github.com/vunhatminh/FL_Attacks.git "
abstract: " With the rapid adoption of Federated Learning (FL) as the training and
  tuning protocol for applications utilizing Large Language Models (LLMs), recent
  research highlights the need for significant modifications to FL to accommodate
  the large-scale of LLMs. While substantial adjustments to the protocol have been
  introduced as a response, comprehensive privacy analysis for the adapted FL protocol
  is currently lacking. To address this gap, our work delves into an extensive examination
  of the privacy analysis of FL when used for training LLMs, both from theoretical
  and practical perspectives. In particular, we design two active membership inference
  attacks with guaranteed theoretical success rates to assess the privacy leakages
  of various adapted FL configurations. Our theoretical findings are translated into
  practical attacks, revealing substantial privacy vulnerabilities in popular LLMs,
  including BERT, RoBERTa, DistilBERT, and OpenAI’s GPTs, across multiple real-world
  language datasets. Additionally, we conduct thorough experiments to evaluate the
  privacy leakage of these models when data is protected by state-of-the-art differential
  privacy (DP) mechanisms. "
