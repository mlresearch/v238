title: " Ordinal Potential-based Player Rating "
abstract: " It was recently observed that Elo ratings fail at preserving transitive
  relations among strategies and therefore cannot correctly extract the transitive
  component of a game. We provide a characterization of transitive games as a weak
  variant of ordinal potential games and show that Elo ratings actually do preserve
  transitivity when computed in the right space, using suitable invertible mappings.
  Leveraging this insight, we introduce a new game decomposition of an arbitrary game
  into transitive and cyclic components that is learnt using a neural network-based
  architecture and that prioritises capturing the sign pattern of the game, namely
  transitive and cyclic relations among strategies. We link our approach to the known
  concept of sign-rank, and evaluate our methodology using both toy examples and empirical
  data from real-world games. "
