title: " A Greedy Approximation for k-Determinantal Point Processes "
software: " https://github.com/JuliaGrosse/GreedykDPPSampling "
abstract: " Determinantal point processes (DPPs) are an important concept in random
  matrix theory and combinatorics, and increasingly in machine learning. Samples from
  these processes exhibit a form of self-avoidance, so they are also helpful in guiding
  algorithms that explore to reduce uncertainty, such as in active learning, Bayesian
  optimization, reinforcement learning, and marginalization in graphical models. The
  best-known algorithms for sampling from DPPs exactly require significant computational
  expense, which can be unwelcome in machine learning applications when the cost of
  sampling is relatively low and capturing the precise repulsive nature of the DPP
  may not be critical. We suggest an inexpensive approximate strategy for sampling
  a fixed number of points (as would typically be desired in a machine learning setting)
  from a so-called $k$-DPP based on iterative inverse transform sampling. We prove
  that our algorithm satisfies a $(1 - 1/\\epsilon)$ approximation guarantee relative
  to exact sampling from the $k$-DPP, and provide an efficient implementation for
  many common kernels used in machine learning, including the Gaussian and Matérn
  class. Finally, we compare the empirical runtime of our method to exact and Markov-Chain-Monte-Carlo
  (MCMC) samplers and investigate the approximation quality in a Bayesian Quadrature
  (BQ) setting. "
