abstract: " Recent advancements in statistical and reinforcement learning methods
  have contributed to superior patient care strategies. However, these methods face
  substantial challenges in high-stakes contexts, including missing data, stochasticity,
  and the need for interpretability and patient safety. Our work operationalizes a
  safe and interpretable approach for optimizing treatment regimes by matching patients
  with similar medical and pharmacological profiles. This allows us to construct optimal
  policies via interpolation. Our comprehensive simulation study demonstrates our
  method’s effectiveness in complex scenarios. We use this approach to study seizure
  treatment in critically ill patients, advocating for personalized strategies based
  on medical history and pharmacological features. Our findings recommend reducing
  medication doses for mild, brief seizure episodes and adopting aggressive treatment
  strategies for severe cases, leading to improved outcomes. "
