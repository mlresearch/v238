title: " Symmetric Equilibrium Learning of VAEs "
software: " https://github.com/dschles70/symvae-aistats2024 "
abstract: " We view variational autoencoders (VAE) as decoder-encoder pairs, which
  map distributions in the data space to distributions in the latent space and vice
  versa. The standard learning approach for VAEs is the maximisation of the evidence
  lower bound (ELBO). It is asymmetric in that it aims at learning a latent variable
  model while using the encoder as an auxiliary means only. Moreover, it requires
  a closed form a-priori latent distribution. This limits its applicability in more
  complex scenarios, such as general semi-supervised learning and employing complex
  generative models as priors. We propose a Nash equilibrium learning approach, which
  is symmetric with respect to the encoder and decoder and allows learning VAEs in
  situations where both the data and the latent distributions are accessible only
  by sampling. The flexibility and simplicity of this approach allows its application
  to a wide range of learning scenarios and downstream tasks. "
