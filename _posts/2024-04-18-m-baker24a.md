title: " Monotone Operator Theory-Inspired Message Passing for Learning Long-Range
  Interaction on Graphs "
software: " https://github.com/Utah-Math-Data-Science/PR-inspired-aggregation "
abstract: " Learning long-range interactions (LRI) between distant nodes is crucial
  for many graph learning tasks. Predominant graph neural networks (GNNs) rely on
  local message passing and struggle to learn LRI. In this paper, we propose DRGNN
  to learn LRI leveraging monotone operator theory. DRGNN contains two key components:
  (1) we use a full node similarity matrix beyond adjacency matrix – drawing inspiration
  from the personalized PageRank matrix – as the aggregation matrix for message passing,
  and (2) we implement message-passing on graphs using Douglas-Rachford splitting
  to circumvent prohibitive matrix inversion. We demonstrate that DRGNN surpasses
  various advanced GNNs, including Transformer-based models, on several benchmark
  LRI learning tasks arising from different application domains, highlighting its
  efficacy in learning LRI. Code is available at \\url{https://github.com/Utah-Math-Data-Science/PR-inspired-aggregation}. "
