title: " VEC-SBM: Optimal Community Detection with Vectorial Edges Covariates "
software: " https://github.com/glmbraun/VECSBM "
abstract: " Social networks are often associated with rich side information, such
  as texts and images. While numerous methods have been developed to identify communities
  from pairwise interactions, they usually ignore such side information. In this work,
  we study an extension of the Stochastic Block Model (SBM), a widely used statistical
  framework for community detection, that integrates vectorial edges covariates: the
  Vectorial Edges Covariates Stochastic Block Model (VEC-SBM). We propose a novel
  algorithm based on iterative refinement techniques and show that it optimally recovers
  the latent communities under the VEC-SBM. Furthermore, we rigorously assess the
  added value of leveraging edge’s side information in the community detection process.
  We complement our theoretical results with numerical experiments on synthetic and
  semi-synthetic data. "
