title: " Leveraging Continuous Time to Understand Momentum When Training Diagonal
  Linear Networks "
abstract: " In this work, we investigate the effect of momentum on the optimisation
  trajectory of gradient descent. We leverage a continuous-time approach in the analysis
  of momentum gradient descent with step size $\\gamma$ and momentum parameter $\\beta$
  that allows us to identify an intrinsic quantity $\\lambda = \\frac{ \\gamma }{
  (1 - \\beta)^2 }$ which uniquely defines the optimisation path and provides a simple
  acceleration rule. When training a $2$-layer diagonal linear network in an overparametrised
  regression setting, we characterise the recovered solution through an implicit regularisation
  problem. We then prove that small values of $\\lambda$ help to recover sparse solutions.
  Finally, we give similar but weaker results for stochastic momentum gradient descent.
  We provide numerical experiments which support our claims. "
