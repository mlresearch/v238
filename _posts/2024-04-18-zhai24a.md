title: " Learning Sampling Policy to Achieve Fewer Queries for Zeroth-Order Optimization "
abstract: " Zeroth-order (ZO) methods, which use the finite difference of two function
  evaluations (also called ZO gradient) to approximate first-order gradient, have
  attracted much attention recently in machine learning because of their broad applications.
  The accuracy of the ZO gradient highly depends on how many finite differences are
  averaged, which are intrinsically determined by the number of perturbations randomly
  drawn from a distribution. Existing ZO methods try to learn a data-driven distribution
  for sampling the perturbations to improve the efficiency of ZO optimization (ZOO)
  algorithms. In this paper, we explore a new and parallel direction, \\textit{i.e.},
  learn an optimal sampling policy instead of using a totally random strategy to generate
  perturbations based on the techniques of reinforcement learning (RL), which makes
  it possible to approximate the gradient with only two function evaluations. Specifically,
  we first formulate the problem of learning a sampling policy as a Markov decision
  process. Then, we propose our ZO-RL algorithm, \\textit{i.e.}, using deep deterministic
  policy gradient, an actor-critic RL algorithm to learn a sampling policy that can
  guide the generation of perturbed vectors in getting ZO gradients as accurately
  as possible. Importantly, the existing ZOO algorithms for learning a distribution
  can be plugged in to improve the exploration of ZO-RL. Experimental results with
  different ZO estimators show that our ZO-RL algorithm can effectively reduce the
  query complexity of ZOO algorithms and converge faster than existing ZOO algorithms,
  especially in the later stage of the optimization process. "
