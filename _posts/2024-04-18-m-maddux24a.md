software: " https://github.com/amaddux9/Multi-Agent-Learning-in-Contextual-Games-under-Unknown-Constraints "
abstract: " We consider the problem of learning to play a repeated contextual game
  with unknown reward and unknown constraints functions. Such games arise in applications
  where each agent’s action needs to belong to a feasible set, but the feasible set
  is a priori unknown. For example, in constrained multi-agent reinforcement learning,
  the constraints on the agents’ policies are a function of the unknown dynamics and
  hence, are themselves unknown. Under kernel-based regularity assumptions on the
  unknown functions, we develop a no-regret, no-violation approach that exploits similarities
  among different reward and constraint outcomes. The no-violation property ensures
  that the time-averaged sum of constraint violations converges to zero as the game
  is repeated. We show that our algorithm referred to as c.z.AdaNormalGP, obtains
  kernel-dependent regret bounds, and the cumulative constraint violations have sublinear
  kernel-dependent upper bounds. In addition, we introduce the notion of constrained
  contextual coarse correlated equilibria (c.z.CCE) and show that $\\epsilon$-c.z.CCEs
  can be approached whenever players follow a no-regret no-violation strategy. Finally,
  we experimentally demonstrate the effectiveness of c.z.AdaNormalGP on an instance
  of multi-agent reinforcement learning. "
