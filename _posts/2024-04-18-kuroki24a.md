title: " Best-of-Both-Worlds Algorithms for Linear Contextual Bandits "
abstract: " We study best-of-both-worlds algorithms for $K$-armed linear contextual
  bandits. Our algorithms deliver near-optimal regret bounds in both the adversarial
  and stochastic regimes, without prior knowledge about the environment. In the stochastic
  regime, we achieve the polylogarithmic rate $\\frac{(dK)^2\\mathrm{poly}\\!\\log(dKT)}{\\Delta_{\\min}}$,
  where $\\Delta_{\\min}$ is the minimum suboptimality gap over the $d$-dimensional
  context space. In the adversarial regime, we obtain either the first-order $\\widetilde{\\mathcal{O}}(dK\\sqrt{L^*})$
  bound, or the second-order $\\widetilde{\\mathcal{O}}(dK\\sqrt{\\Lambda^*})$ bound,
  where $L^*$ is the cumulative loss of the best action and $\\Lambda^*$ is a notion
  of the cumulative second moment for the losses incurred by the algorithm. Moreover,
  we develop an algorithm based on FTRL with Shannon entropy regularizer that does
  not require the knowledge of the inverse of the covariance matrix, and achieves
  a polylogarithmic regret in the stochastic regime while obtaining $\\widetilde{\\mathcal{O}}\\big(dK\\sqrt{T}\\big)$
  regret bounds in the adversarial regime. "
