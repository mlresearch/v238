title: " Large-Scale Gaussian Processes via Alternating Projection "
software: " https://github.com/kayween/alternating-projection-for-gp "
abstract: " Training and inference in Gaussian processes (GPs) require solving linear
  systems with $n\\times n$ kernel matrices. To address the prohibitive $\\mathcal{O}(n^3)$
  time complexity, recent work has employed fast iterative methods, like conjugate
  gradients (CG). However, as datasets increase in magnitude, the kernel matrices
  become increasingly ill-conditioned and still require $\\mathcal{O}(n^2)$ space
  without partitioning. Thus, while CG increases the size of datasets GPs can be trained
  on, modern datasets reach scales beyond its applicability. In this work, we propose
  an iterative method which only accesses subblocks of the kernel matrix, effectively
  enabling mini-batching. Our algorithm, based on alternating projection, has $\\mathcal{O}(n)$
  per-iteration time and space complexity, solving many of the practical challenges
  of scaling GPs to very large datasets. Theoretically, we prove the method enjoys
  linear convergence. Empirically, we demonstrate its fast convergence in practice
  and robustness to ill-conditioning. On large-scale benchmark datasets with up to
  four million data points, our approach accelerates GP training and inference by
  speed-up factors up to $27\\times$ and $72 \\times$, respectively, compared to CG. "
