title: " On Ranking-based Tests of Independence "
software: " https://github.com/MyrtoLimnios/independence_ranktest "
abstract: " In this paper we develop a novel nonparametric framework to test the independence
  of two random variables $X$ and $Y$ with unknown respective marginals $H(dx)$ and
  $G(dy)$ and joint distribution $F(dxdy)$, based on Receiver Operating Characteristic
  (ROC) analysis and bipartite ranking. The rationale behind our approach relies on
  the fact that, the independence hypothesis $\\mathcal{H}_0$ is necessarily false
  as soon as the optimal scoring function related to the pair of distributions $(H\\otimes
  G,;{F})$, obtained from a bipartite ranking algorithm, has a ROC curve that deviates
  from the main diagonal of the unit square. We consider a wide class of rank statistics
  encompassing many ways of deviating from the diagonal in the ROC space to build
  tests of independence. Beyond its great flexibility, this new method has theoretical
  properties that far surpass those of its competitors. Nonasymptotic bounds for the
  two types of testing errors are established. From an empirical perspective, the
  novel procedure we promote in this paper exhibits a remarkable ability to detect
  small departures, of various types, from the null assumption $\\mathcal{H}_0$, even
  in high dimension, as supported by the numerical experiments presented here. "
