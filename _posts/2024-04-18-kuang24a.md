title: " Unveiling Latent Causal Rules: A Temporal Point Process Approach for Abnormal
  Event Explanation "
software: " https://github.com/000kylie000/EventSequenceClustering "
abstract: " In high-stakes systems such as healthcare, it is critical to understand
  the causal reasons behind unusual events, such as sudden changes in patient’s health.
  Unveiling the causal reasons helps with quick diagnoses and precise treatment planning.
  In this paper, we propose an automated method for uncovering “if-then” logic rules
  to explain observational events. We introduce {\\it temporal point processes} to
  model the events of interest, and discover the set of latent rules to explain the
  occurrence of events. To achieve this goal, we employ an Expectation-Maximization
  (EM) algorithm. In the E-step, we calculate the posterior probability of each event
  being explained by each discovered rule. In the M-step, we update both the rule
  set and model parameters to enhance the likelihood function’s lower bound. Notably,
  we will optimize the rule set in a {\\it differential} manner. Our approach demonstrates
  accurate performance in both discovering rules and identifying root causes. We showcase
  its promising results using synthetic and real healthcare datasets. "
