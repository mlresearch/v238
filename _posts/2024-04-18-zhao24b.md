title: " On Feynman-Kac training of partial Bayesian neural networks "
software: " https://github.com/spdes/pbnn "
abstract: " Recently, partial Bayesian neural networks (pBNNs), which only consider
  a subset of the parameters to be stochastic, were shown to perform competitively
  with full Bayesian neural networks. However, pBNNs are often multi-modal in the
  latent variable space and thus challenging to approximate with parametric models.
  To address this problem, we propose an efficient sampling-based training strategy,
  wherein the training of a pBNN is formulated as simulating a Feynman-Kac model.
  We then describe variations of sequential Monte Carlo samplers that allow us to
  simultaneously estimate the parameters and the latent posterior distribution of
  this model at a tractable computational cost. Using various synthetic and real-world
  datasets we show that our proposed training scheme outperforms the state of the
  art in terms of predictive performance. "
