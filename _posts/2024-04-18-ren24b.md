title: " Multi-objective Optimization via Wasserstein-Fisher-Rao Gradient Flow "
software: " https://github.com/yinuoren/particlewfr "
abstract: " Multi-objective optimization (MOO) aims to optimize multiple, possibly
  conflicting objectives with widespread applications. We introduce a novel interacting
  particle method for MOO inspired by molecular dynamics simulations. Our approach
  combines overdamped Langevin and birth-death dynamics, incorporating a “dominance
  potential” to steer particles toward global Pareto optimality. In contrast to previous
  methods, our method is able to relocate dominated particles, making it particularly
  adept at managing Pareto fronts of complicated geometries. Our method is also theoretically
  grounded as a Wasserstein-Fisher-Rao gradient flow with convergence guarantees.
  Extensive experiments confirm that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods
  on challenging synthetic and real-world datasets. "
