title: " Krylov Cubic Regularized Newton: A Subspace Second-Order Method with Dimension-Free
  Convergence Rate "
software: " https://github.com/Raymond30/Krylov-Cubic-Regularized-Newton "
abstract: " Second-order optimization methods, such as cubic regularized Newton methods,
  are known for their rapid convergence rates; nevertheless, they become impractical
  in high-dimensional problems due to their substantial memory requirements and computational
  costs. One promising approach is to execute second-order updates within a lower-dimensional
  subspace, giving rise to subspace second-order methods. However, the majority of
  existing subspace second-order methods randomly select subspaces, consequently resulting
  in slower convergence rates depending on the problem’s dimension $d$. In this paper,
  we introduce a novel subspace cubic regularized Newton method that achieves a dimension-independent
  global convergence rate of $\\mathcal{O}\\left(\\frac{1}{mk}+\\frac{1}{k^2}\\right)$
  for solving convex optimization problems. Here, $m$ represents the subspace dimension,
  which can be significantly smaller than $d$. Instead of adopting a random subspace,
  our primary innovation involves performing the cubic regularized Newton update within
  the \\emph{Krylov subspace} associated with the Hessian and the gradient of the
  objective function. This result marks the first instance of a dimension-independent
  convergence rate for a subspace second-order method. Furthermore, when specific
  spectral conditions of the Hessian are met, our method recovers the convergence
  rate of a full-dimensional cubic regularized Newton method. Numerical experiments
  show our method converges faster than existing random subspace methods, especially
  for high-dimensional problems. "
