title: " Near-Optimal Policy Optimization for Correlated Equilibrium in General-Sum
  Markov Games "
abstract: " We study policy optimization algorithms for computing correlated equilibria
  in multi-player general-sum Markov Games. Previous results achieve $\\tilde{O}(T^{-1/2})$
  convergence rate to a correlated equilibrium and an accelerated $\\tilde{O}(T^{-3/4})$
  convergence rate to the weaker notion of coarse correlated equilibrium. In this
  paper, we improve both results significantly by providing an uncoupled policy optimization
  algorithm that attains a near-optimal $\\tilde{O}(T^{-1})$ convergence rate for
  computing a correlated equilibrium. Our algorithm is constructed by combining two
  main elements (i) smooth value updates and (ii) the \\emph{optimistic-follow-the-regularized-leader}
  algorithm with the log barrier regularizer. "
