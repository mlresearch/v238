title: " Fusing Individualized Treatment Rules Using Secondary Outcomes "
software: " https://github.com/DqGao/Fused-Individualized-Treatment-Rule.git "
abstract: " An individualized treatment rule (ITR) is a decision rule that recommends
  treatments for patients based on their individual feature variables. In many practices,
  the ideal ITR for the primary outcome is also expected to cause minimal harm to
  other secondary outcomes. Therefore, our objective is to learn an ITR that not only
  maximizes the value function for the primary outcome, but also approximates the
  optimal rule for the secondary outcomes as closely as possible. To achieve this
  goal, we introduce a fusion penalty to encourage the ITRs based on different outcomes
  to yield similar recommendations. Two algorithms are proposed to estimate the ITR
  using surrogate loss functions. We prove that the agreement rate between the estimated
  ITR of the primary outcome and the optimal ITRs of the secondary outcomes converges
  to the true agreement rate faster than if the secondary outcomes are not taken into
  consideration. Furthermore, we derive the non-asymptotic properties of the value
  function and misclassification rate for the proposed method. Finally, simulation
  studies and a real data example are used to demonstrate the finite-sample performance
  of the proposed method. "
