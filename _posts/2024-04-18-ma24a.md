title: " Absence of spurious solutions far from ground truth: A low-rank analysis
  with high-order losses "
software: " https://github.com/anonpapersbm/high_order_obj "
abstract: " Matrix sensing problems exhibit pervasive non-convexity, plaguing optimization
  with a proliferation of suboptimal spurious solutions. Avoiding convergence to these
  critical points poses a major challenge. This work provides new theoretical insights
  that help demystify the intricacies of the non-convex landscape. In this work, we
  prove that under certain conditions, critical points sufficiently distant from the
  ground truth matrix exhibit favorable geometry by being strict saddle points rather
  than troublesome local minima. Moreover, we introduce the notion of higher-order
  losses for the matrix sensing problem and show that the incorporation of such losses
  into the objective function amplifies the negative curvature around those distant
  critical points. This implies that increasing the complexity of the objective function
  via high-order losses accelerates the escape from such critical points and acts
  as a desirable alternative to increasing the complexity of the optimization problem
  via over-parametrization. By elucidating key characteristics of the non-convex optimization
  landscape, this work makes progress towards a comprehensive framework for tackling
  broader machine learning objectives plagued by non-convexity. "
