title: " Independent Learning in Constrained Markov Potential Games "
software: " https://github.com/philip-jordan/iProx-CMPG "
abstract: " Constrained Markov games offer a formal mathematical framework for modeling
  multi-agent reinforcement learning problems where the behavior of the agents is
  subject to constraints. In this work, we focus on the recently introduced class
  of constrained Markov Potential Games. While centralized algorithms have been proposed
  for solving such constrained games, the design of converging independent learning
  algorithms tailored for the constrained setting remains an open question. We propose
  an independent policy gradient algorithm for learning approximate constrained Nash
  equilibria: Each agent observes their own actions and rewards, along with a shared
  state. Inspired by the optimization literature, our algorithm performs proximal-point-like
  updates augmented with a regularized constraint set. Each proximal step is solved
  inexactly using a stochastic switching gradient algorithm. Notably, our algorithm
  can be implemented independently without a centralized coordination mechanism requiring
  turn-based agent updates. Under some technical constraint qualification conditions,
  we establish convergence guarantees towards constrained approximate Nash equilibria.
  We perform simulations to illustrate our results. "
