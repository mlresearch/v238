title: " Computing epidemic metrics with edge differential privacy "
abstract: " Metrics such as the outbreak size in an epidemic process on a network
  are fundamental quantities used in public health analyses. The datasets used in
  such models used in practice, e.g., the contact network and disease states, are
  sensitive in many settings. We study the complexity of computing epidemic outbreak
  size within a given time horizon, under edge differential privacy. These quantities
  have high sensitivity, and we show that giving algorithms with good utility guarantees
  is impossible for general graphs. To address these hardness results, we consider
  a smaller class of graphs with similar properties as social networks (called expander
  graphs) and give a polynomial-time algorithm with strong utility guarantees. Our
  results are the first to give any non-trivial guarantees for differentially private
  infection size estimation. "
