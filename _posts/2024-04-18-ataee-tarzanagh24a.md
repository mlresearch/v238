title: " Online Bilevel Optimization: Regret Analysis of Online Alternating Gradient
  Methods "
software: " https://github.com/bojianhou/oagd "
abstract: " This paper introduces \\textit{online bilevel optimization} in which a
  sequence of time-varying bilevel problems is revealed one after the other. We extend
  the known regret bounds for single-level online algorithms to the bilevel setting.
  Specifically, we provide new notions of \\textit{bilevel regret}, develop an online
  alternating time-averaged gradient method that is capable of leveraging smoothness,
  and give regret bounds in terms of the path-length of the inner and outer minimizer
  sequences. "
