title: " Identifying Spurious Biases Early in Training through the Lens of Simplicity
  Bias "
software: " https://github.com/BigML-CS-UCLA/SPARE "
abstract: " Neural networks trained with (stochastic) gradient descent have an inductive
  bias towards learning simpler solutions. This makes them highly prone to learning
  spurious correlations in the training data, that may not hold at test time. In this
  work, we provide the first theoretical analysis of the effect of simplicity bias
  on learning spurious correlations. Notably, we show that examples with spurious
  features are provably separable based on the model’s output early in training. We
  further illustrate that if spurious features have a small enough noise-to-signal
  ratio, the network’s output on majority of examples is almost exclusively determined
  by the spurious features, leading to poor worst-group test accuracy. Finally, we
  propose SPARE, which identifies spurious correlations early in training, and utilizes
  importance sampling to alleviate their effect. Empirically, we demonstrate that
  SPARE outperforms state-of-the-art methods by up to 21.1% in worst-group accuracy,
  while being up to 12x faster. We also show the applicability of SPARE, as a highly
  effective but lightweight method, to discover spurious correlations. "
