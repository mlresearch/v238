title: " Regret Bounds for Risk-sensitive Reinforcement Learning with Lipschitz Dynamic
  Risk Measures "
abstract: " We study finite episodic Markov decision processes incorporating dynamic
  risk measures to capture risk sensitivity. To this end, we present two model-based
  algorithms applied to \\emph{Lipschitz} dynamic risk measures, a wide range of risk
  measures that subsumes spectral risk measure, optimized certainty equivalent, and
  distortion risk measures, among others. We establish both regret upper bounds and
  lower bounds. Notably, our upper bounds demonstrate optimal dependencies on the
  number of actions and episodes while reflecting the inherent trade-off between risk
  sensitivity and sample complexity. Our approach offers a unified framework that
  not only encompasses multiple existing formulations in the literature but also broadens
  the application spectrum. "
