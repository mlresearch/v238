abstract: " The safe linear bandit problem is a version of the classical stochastic
  linear bandit problem where the learner’s actions must satisfy an uncertain constraint
  at all rounds. Due its applicability to many real-world settings, this problem has
  received considerable attention in recent years. By leveraging a novel approach
  that we call directional optimism, we find that it is possible to achieve improved
  regret guarantees for both well-separated problem instances and action sets that
  are finite star convex sets. Furthermore, we propose a novel algorithm for this
  setting that improves on existing algorithms in terms of empirical performance,
  while enjoying matching regret guarantees. Lastly, we introduce a generalization
  of the safe linear bandit setting where the constraints are convex and adapt our
  algorithms and analyses to this setting by leveraging a novel convex-analysis based
  approach. "
