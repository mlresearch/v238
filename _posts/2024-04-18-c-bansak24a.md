title: " Learning Under Random Distributional Shifts "
software: " https://github.com/kbansak/Learning-under-random-distributional-shifts "
abstract: " Many existing approaches for generating predictions in settings with distribution
  shift model distribution shifts as adversarial or low-rank in suitable representations.
  In various real-world settings, however, we might expect shifts to arise through
  the superposition of many small and random changes in the population and environment.
  Thus, we consider a class of random distribution shift models that capture arbitrary
  changes in the underlying covariate space, and dense, random shocks to the relationship
  between the covariates and the outcomes. In this setting, we characterize the benefits
  and drawbacks of several alternative prediction strategies: the standard approach
  that directly predicts the long-term outcomes of interest, the proxy approach that
  directly predicts shorter-term proxy outcomes, and a hybrid approach that utilizes
  both the long-term policy outcome and (shorter-term) proxy outcome(s). We show that
  the hybrid approach is robust to the strength of the distribution shift and the
  proxy relationship. We apply this method to datasets in two high-impact domains:
  asylum-seeker placement and early childhood education. In both settings, we find
  that the proposed approach results in substantially lower mean-squared error than
  current approaches. "
