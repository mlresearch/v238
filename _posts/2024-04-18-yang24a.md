title: " Neural McKean-Vlasov Processes: Distributional Dependence in Diffusion Processes "
software: " https://github.com/imkeithyang/Neural-McKean-Vlasov-Processes "
abstract: " McKean-Vlasov stochastic differential equations (MV-SDEs) provide a mathematical
  description of the behavior of an infinite number of interacting particles by imposing
  a dependence on the particle density. We study the influence of explicitly including
  distributional information in the parameterization of the SDE. We propose a series
  of semi-parametric methods for representing MV-SDEs, and corresponding estimators
  for inferring parameters from data based on the properties of the MV-SDE. We analyze
  the characteristics of the different architectures and estimators, and consider
  their applicability in relevant machine learning problems. We empirically compare
  the performance of the different architectures and estimators on real and synthetic
  datasets for time series and probabilistic modeling. The results suggest that explicitly
  including distributional dependence in the parameterization of the SDE is effective
  in modeling temporal data with interaction under an exchangeability assumption while
  maintaining strong performance for standard Itô-SDEs due to the richer class of
  probability flows associated with MV-SDEs. "
