title: " Interpretable Causal Inference for Analyzing Wearable, Sensor, and Distributional
  Data "
software: " https://github.com/almost-matching-exactly/addmalts "
abstract: " Many modern causal questions ask how treatments affect complex outcomes
  that are measured using wearable devices and sensors. Current analysis approaches
  require summarizing these data into scalar statistics (e.g., the mean), but these
  summaries can be misleading. For example, disparate distributions can have the same
  means, variances, and other statistics. Researchers can overcome the loss in information
  by instead representing the data as distributions. We develop an interpretable method
  for distributional data analysis that ensures trustworthy and robust decision making:
  Analyzing Distributional Data via Matching After Learning to Stretch (ADD MALTS).
  We (i) provide analytical guarantees of the correctness of our estimation strategy,
  (ii) demonstrate via simulation that ADD MALTS outperforms other distributional
  data analysis methods at estimating treatment effects, and (iii) illustrate ADD
  MALTS’ ability to verify whether there is enough cohesion between treatment and
  control units within subpopulations to trustworthily estimate treatment effects.
  We demonstrate ADD MALTS’ utility by studying the effectiveness of continuous glucose
  monitors in mitigating diabetes risks. "
