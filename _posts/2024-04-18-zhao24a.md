title: " Positivity-free Policy Learning with Observational Data "
software: " https://github.com/panzhaooo/positivity-free-policy-learning "
abstract: " Policy learning utilizing observational data is pivotal across various
  domains, with the objective of learning the optimal treatment assignment policy
  while adhering to specific constraints such as fairness, budget, and simplicity.
  This study introduces a novel positivity-free (stochastic) policy learning framework
  designed to address the challenges posed by the impracticality of the positivity
  assumption in real-world scenarios. This framework leverages incremental propensity
  score policies to adjust propensity score values instead of assigning fixed values
  to treatments. We characterize these incremental propensity score policies and establish
  identification conditions, employing semiparametric efficiency theory to propose
  efficient estimators capable of achieving rapid convergence rates, even when integrated
  with advanced machine learning algorithms. This paper provides a thorough exploration
  of the theoretical guarantees associated with policy learning and validates the
  proposed framework’s finite-sample performance through comprehensive numerical experiments,
  ensuring the identification of causal effects from observational data is both robust
  and reliable. "
