software: " https://github.com/HeddaCohenIndelman/Learning-Latent-Partial-Matchings-with-Gumbel-IPF-Networks "
abstract: " Learning to match discrete objects has been a central task in machine
  learning, often facilitated by a continuous relaxation of the matching structure.
  However, practical problems entail partial matchings due to missing correspondences,
  which pose difficulties to the one-to-one matching learning techniques that dominate
  the state-of-the-art. This paper introduces Gumbel-IPF networks for learning latent
  partial matchings. At the core of our method is the differentiable Iterative Proportional
  Fitting (IPF) procedure that biproportionally projects onto the transportation polytope
  of target marginals. Our theoretical framework also allows drawing samples from
  the temperature-dependent partial matching distribution. We investigate the properties
  of common-practice relaxations through the lens of biproportional fitting and introduce
  a new metric, the empirical prediction shift. Our method’s advantages are demonstrated
  in experimental results on the semantic keypoints partial matching task on the Pascal
  VOC, IMC-PT-SparseGM, and CUB2001 datasets. "
