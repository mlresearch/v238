title: " Multiclass Learning from Noisy Labels for Non-decomposable Performance Measures "
software: " https://github.com/moshimowang/noisy-labels-non-decomposable "
abstract: " There has been much interest in recent years in learning good classifiers
  from data with noisy labels. Most work on learning from noisy labels has focused
  on standard loss-based performance measures. However, many machine learning problems
  require using non-decomposable performance measures which cannot be expressed as
  the expectation or sum of a loss on individual examples; these include for example
  the H-mean, Q-mean and G-mean in class imbalance settings, and the Micro F1 in information
  retrieval. In this paper, we design algorithms to learn from noisy labels for two
  broad classes of multiclass non-decomposable performance measures, namely, monotonic
  convex and ratio-of-linear, which encompass all the above examples. Our work builds
  on the Frank-Wolfe and Bisection based methods of Narasimhan et al. (2015). In both
  cases, we develop noise-corrected versions of the algorithms under the widely studied
  family of class-conditional noise models. We provide regret (excess risk) bounds
  for our algorithms, establishing that even though they are trained on noisy data,
  they are Bayes consistent in the sense that their performance converges to the optimal
  performance w.r.t. the clean (non-noisy) distribution. Our experiments demonstrate
  the effectiveness of our algorithms in handling label noise. "
