title: " Asynchronous SGD on Graphs: a Unified Framework for Asynchronous Decentralized
  and Federated Optimization "
abstract: " Decentralized and asynchronous communications are two popular techniques
  to speedup communication complexity of distributed machine learning, by respectively
  removing the dependency over a central orchestrator and the need for synchronization.
  Yet, combining these two techniques together still remains a challenge. In this
  paper, we take a step in this direction and introduce Asynchronous SGD on Graphs
  (AGRAF SGD) — a general algorithmic framework that covers asynchronous versions
  of many popular algorithms including SGD, Decentralized SGD, Local SGD, FedBuff,
  thanks to its relaxed communication and computation assumptions. We provide rates
  of convergence under much milder assumptions than previous decentralized asynchronous
  works, while still recovering or even improving over the best know results for all
  the algorithms covered. "
