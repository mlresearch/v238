title: " Enhancing Distributional Stability among Sub-populations "
software: " https://github.com/LJSthu/SRM "
abstract: ' Enhancing the stability of machine learning algorithms under distributional
  shifts is at the heart of the Out-of-Distribution (OOD) Generalization problem.
  Derived from causal learning, recent works of invariant learning pursue strict invariance
  with multiple training environments. Although intuitively reasonable, strong assumptions
  on the availability and quality of environments are made to learn the strict invariance
  property. In this work, we come up with the “distributional stability" notion to
  mitigate such limitations. It quantifies the stability of prediction mechanisms
  among sub-populations down to a prescribed scale. Based on this, we propose the
  learnability assumption and derive the generalization error bound under distribution
  shifts. Inspired by theoretical analyses, we propose our novel stable risk minimization
  (SRM) algorithm to enhance the model’s stability w.r.t. shifts in prediction mechanisms
  (Y|X-shifts). Experimental results are consistent with our intuition and validate
  the effectiveness of our algorithm. The code can be found at https://github.com/LJSthu/SRM. '
