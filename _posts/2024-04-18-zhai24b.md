title: " Deep Learning-Based Alternative Route Computation "
abstract: " Algorithms for the computation of alternative routes in road networks
  power many geographic navigation systems. A good set of alternative routes offers
  meaningful options to the user of the system and can support applications such as
  routing that is robust to failures (e.g., road closures, extreme traffic congestion,
  etc.) and routing with diverse preferences and objective functions. Algorithmic
  techniques for alternative route computation include the penalty method, via-node
  type algorithms (which deploy bidirectional search and finding plateaus), and, more
  recently, electrical-circuit based algorithms. In this work we focus on the practically
  important family of via-node type algorithms and aim to produce high quality alternative
  routes for road networks using a novel deep learning-based approach that learns
  a representation of the underlying road network. We show that this approach can
  support natural objectives, such as the uniformly bounded stretch, that are difficult
  and computationally expensive to support through traditional algorithmic techniques.
  Moreover, we achieve this in a practical system based on the Customizable Route
  Planning (CRP) hierarchical routing architecture. Our training methodology uses
  the hierarchical partition of the graph and trains a model to predict which boundary
  nodes in the partition should be crossed by the alternative routes. We describe
  our methods in detail and evaluate them against previously studied baselines, showing
  quality improvements in the road networks of Seattle, Paris, and Bangalore. "
