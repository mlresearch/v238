title: " General Identifiability and Achievability for Causal Representation Learning "
software: " https://github.com/bvarici/score-general-id-CRL "
abstract: " This paper focuses on causal representation learning (CRL) under a general
  nonparametric latent causal model and a general transformation model that maps the
  latent data to the observational data. It establishes identifiability and achievability
  results using two hard uncoupled interventions per node in the latent causal graph.
  Notably, one does not know which pair of intervention environments have the same
  node intervened (hence, uncoupled). For identifiability, the paper establishes that
  perfect recovery of the latent causal model and variables is guaranteed under uncoupled
  interventions. For achievability, an algorithm is designed that uses observational
  and interventional data and recovers the latent causal model and variables with
  provable guarantees. This algorithm leverages score variations across different
  environments to estimate the inverse of the transformer and, subsequently, the latent
  variables. The analysis, additionally, recovers the identifiability result for two
  hard coupled interventions, that is when metadata about the pair of environments
  that have the same node intervened is known. This paper also shows that when observational
  data is available, additional faithfulness assumptions that are adopted by the existing
  literature are unnecessary. "
