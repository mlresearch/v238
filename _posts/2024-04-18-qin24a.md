title: " A General Algorithm for Solving Rank-one Matrix Sensing "
abstract: " Matrix sensing has many real-world applications in science and engineering,
  such as system control, distance embedding, and computer vision. The goal of matrix
  sensing is to recover a matrix $A_\\star \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n \\times n}$, based
  on a sequence of measurements $(u_i,b_i) \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n} \\times \\mathbb{R}$
  such that $u_i^\\top A_\\star u_i = b_i$. Previous work (Zhong et al., 2015) focused
  on the scenario where matrix $A_{\\star}$ has a small rank, e.g. rank-$k$. Their
  analysis heavily relies on the RIP assumption, making it unclear how to generalize
  to high-rank matrices. In this paper, we relax that rank-$k$ assumption and solve
  a much more general matrix sensing problem. Given an accuracy parameter $\\delta
  \\in (0,1)$, we can compute $A \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n \\times n}$ in $\\widetilde{O}(m^{3/2}
  n^2 \\delta^{-1} )$, such that $ |u_i^\\top A u_i - b_i| \\leq \\delta$ for all
  $i \\in [m]$. We design an efficient algorithm with provable convergence guarantees
  using stochastic gradient descent for this problem. "
