title: " Agnostic Multi-Robust Learning using ERM "
abstract: " A fundamental problem in robust learning is asymmetry: a learner needs
  to correctly classify every one of exponentially-many perturbations that an adversary
  might make to a test-time natural example. In contrast, the attacker only needs
  to find one successful perturbation. Xiang et al.[2022] proposed an algorithm that
  in the context of patch attacks for image classification, reduces the effective
  number of perturbations from an exponential to a polynomial number of perturbations
  and learns using an ERM oracle. However, to achieve its guarantee, their algorithm
  requires the natural examples to be robustly realizable. This prompts the natural
  question; can we extend their approach to the non-robustly-realizable case where
  there is no classifier with zero robust error? Our first contribution is to answer
  this question affirmatively by reducing this problem to a setting in which an algorithm
  proposed by Feige et al. [2015] can be applied, and in the process extend their
  guarantees. Next, we extend our results to a multi-group setting and introduce a
  novel agnostic multi-robust learning problem where the goal is to learn a predictor
  that achieves low robust loss on a (potentially) rich collection of subgroups. "
