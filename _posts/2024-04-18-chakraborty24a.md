title: " PrIsing: Privacy-Preserving Peer Effect Estimation via Ising Model "
software: " https://github.com/anirbanc96/PrIsing "
abstract: " The Ising model, originally developed as a spin-glass model for ferromagnetic
  elements, has gained popularity as a network-based model for capturing dependencies
  in agents’ outputs. Its increasing adoption in healthcare and the social sciences
  has raised privacy concerns regarding the confidentiality of agents’ responses.
  In this paper, we present a novel $(\\varepsilon,\\delta)$-differentially private
  algorithm specifically designed to protect the privacy of individual agents’ outcomes.
  Our algorithm allows for precise estimation of the natural parameter using a single
  network through an objective perturbation technique. Furthermore, we establish regret
  bounds for this algorithm and assess its performance on synthetic datasets and two
  real-world networks: one involving HIV status in a social network and the other
  concerning the political leaning of online blogs. "
