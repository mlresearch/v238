title: " Ethics in Action: Training Reinforcement Learning Agents for Moral Decision-making
  In Text-based Adventure Games "
software: " https://github.com/WeichenLi1223/Ethics-in-Action "
abstract: " Reinforcement Learning (RL) has demonstrated its potential in solving
  goal-oriented sequential tasks. However, with the increasing capabilities of RL
  agents, ensuring morally responsible agent behavior is becoming a pressing concern.
  Previous approaches have included moral considerations by statically assigning a
  moral score to each action at runtime. However, these methods do not account for
  the potential moral value of future states when evaluating immoral actions. This
  limits the ability to find trade-offs between different aspects of moral behavior
  and the utility of the action. In this paper, we aim to factor in moral scores by
  adding a constraint to the RL objective that is incorporated during training, thereby
  dynamically adapting the policy function. By combining Lagrangian optimization and
  meta-gradient learning, we develop an RL method that is able to find a trade-off
  between immoral behavior and performance in the decision-making process. "
