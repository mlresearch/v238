title: " On the Impact of Overparameterization on the Training of a Shallow Neural
  Network in High Dimensions "
software: " https://github.com/simon-martin-5140/ShallowQuadratic "
abstract: " We study the training dynamics of a shallow neural network with quadratic
  activation functions and quadratic cost in a teacher-student setup. In line with
  previous works on the same neural architecture, the optimization is performed following
  the gradient flow on the population risk, where the average over data points is
  replaced by the expectation over their distribution, assumed to be Gaussian. We
  first derive convergence properties for the gradient flow and quantify the overparameterization
  that is necessary to achieve a strong signal recovery. Then, assuming that the teachers
  and the students at initialization form independent orthonormal families, we derive
  a high-dimensional limit for the flow and show that the minimal overparameterization
  is sufficient for strong recovery. We verify by numerical experiments that these
  results hold for more general initializations. "
