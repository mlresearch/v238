title: " Deep Classifier Mimicry without Data Access "
software: " https://github.com/ml-research/CAKE "
abstract: " Access to pre-trained models has recently emerged as a standard across
  numerous machine learning domains. Unfortunately, access to the original data the
  models were trained on may not equally be granted. This makes it tremendously challenging
  to fine-tune, compress models, adapt continually, or to do any other type of data-driven
  update. We posit that original data access may however not be required. Specifically,
  we propose Contrastive Abductive Knowledge Extraction (CAKE), a model-agnostic knowledge
  distillation procedure that mimics deep classifiers without access to the original
  data. To this end, CAKE generates pairs of noisy synthetic samples and diffuses
  them contrastively toward a model’s decision boundary. We empirically corroborate
  CAKE’s effectiveness using several benchmark datasets and various architectural
  choices, paving the way for broad application. "
