title: " Structured Transforms Across Spaces with Cost-Regularized Optimal Transport "
software: " https://github.com/othmanesebbouh/prox_rot_aistats "
abstract: " Matching a source to a target probability measure is often solved by instantiating
  a linear optimal transport (OT) problem, parameterized by a ground cost function
  that quantifies discrepancy between points. When these measures live in the same
  metric space, the ground cost often defaults to its distance. When instantiated
  across two different spaces, however, choosing that cost in the absence of aligned
  data is a conundrum. As a result, practitioners often resort to solving instead
  a quadratic Gromow-Wasserstein (GW) problem. We exploit in this work a parallel
  between GW and cost-regularized OT, the regularized minimization of a linear OT
  objective parameterized by a ground cost. We use this cost-regularized formulation
  to match measures across two different Euclidean spaces, where the cost is evaluated
  between transformed source points and target points. We show that several quadratic
  OT problems fall in this category, and consider enforcing structure in linear transform
  (e.g., sparsity), by introducing structure-inducing regularizers. We provide a proximal
  algorithm to extract such transforms from unaligned data, and demonstrate its applicability
  to single-cell spatial transcriptomics/multiomics matching tasks. "
