title: " Taming Nonconvex Stochastic Mirror Descent with General Bregman Divergence "
abstract: " This paper revisits the convergence of Stochastic Mirror Descent (SMD)
  in the contemporary nonconvex optimization setting. Existing results for batch-free
  nonconvex SMD restrict the choice of the distance generating function (DGF) to be
  differentiable with Lipschitz continuous gradients, thereby excluding important
  setups such as Shannon entropy. In this work, we present a new convergence analysis
  of nonconvex SMD supporting general DGF, that overcomes the above limitations and
  relies solely on the standard assumptions. Moreover, our convergence is established
  with respect to the Bregman Forward-Backward envelope, which is a stronger measure
  than the commonly used squared norm of gradient mapping. We further extend our results
  to guarantee high probability convergence under sub-Gaussian noise and global convergence
  under the generalized Bregman Proximal Polyak-{Ł}ojasiewicz condition. Additionally,
  we illustrate the advantages of our improved SMD theory in various nonconvex machine
  learning tasks by harnessing nonsmooth DGFs. Notably, in the context of nonconvex
  differentially private (DP) learning, our theory yields a simple algorithm with
  a (nearly) dimension-independent utility bound. For the problem of training linear
  neural networks, we develop provably convergent stochastic algorithms. "
