title: " An Impossibility Theorem for Node Embedding "
abstract: " With the increasing popularity of graph-based methods for dimensionality
  reduction and representation learning, node embedding functions have become important
  objects of study in the literature. In this paper, we take an axiomatic approach
  to understanding node embedding methods. Motivated by desirable properties of node
  embeddings for encoding the role of a node in the structure of a network, we first
  state three properties for embedding dissimilarity networks. We then prove that
  no node embedding method can satisfy all three properties at once, reflecting fundamental
  difficulties inherent to the task. Having identified these difficulties, we show
  that mild relaxations of these axioms allow for certain node embedding methods to
  be admissible. "
