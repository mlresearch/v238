title: " Estimating treatment effects from single-arm trials via latent-variable modeling "
software: " https://github.com/manuelhaussmann/lvm_singlearm "
abstract: " Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) are the accepted standard for treatment
  effect estimation but they can be infeasible due to ethical reasons and prohibitive
  costs. Single-arm trials, where all patients belong to the treatment group, can
  be a viable alternative but require access to an external control group. We propose
  an identifiable deep latent-variable model for this scenario that can also account
  for missing covariate observations by modeling their structured missingness patterns.
  Our method uses amortized variational inference to learn both group-specific and
  identifiable shared latent representations, which can subsequently be used for {\\em
  (i)} patient matching if treatment outcomes are not available for the treatment
  group, or for {\\em (ii)} direct treatment effect estimation assuming outcomes are
  available for both groups. We evaluate the model on a public benchmark as well as
  on a data set consisting of a published RCT study and real-world electronic health
  records. Compared to previous methods, our results show improved performance both
  for direct treatment effect estimation as well as for effect estimation via patient
  matching. "
