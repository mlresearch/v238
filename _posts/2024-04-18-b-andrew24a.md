title: " GmGM: a fast multi-axis Gaussian graphical model "
software: " https://github.com/AIStats-GmGM/GmGM/ "
abstract: " This paper introduces the Gaussian multi-Graphical Model, a model to construct
  sparse graph representations of matrix- and tensor-variate data. We generalize prior
  work in this area by simultaneously learning this representation across several
  tensors that share axes, which is necessary to allow the analysis of multimodal
  datasets such as those encountered in multi-omics. Our algorithm uses only a single
  eigendecomposition per axis, achieving an order of magnitude speedup over prior
  work in the ungeneralized case. This allows the use of our methodology on large
  multi-modal datasets such as single-cell multi-omics data, which was challenging
  with previous approaches. We validate our model on synthetic data and five real-world
  datasets. "
