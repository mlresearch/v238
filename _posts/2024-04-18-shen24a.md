title: " Continual Domain Adversarial Adaptation via Double-Head Discriminators "
software: " https://github.com/yshen22/continual-domain-adversarial-adaptation "
abstract: " Domain adversarial adaptation in a continual setting poses significant
  challenges due to the limitations of accessing previous source domain data. Despite
  extensive research in continual learning, adversarial adaptation cannot be effectively
  accomplished using only a small number of stored source domain data, a standard
  setting in memory replay approaches. This limitation arises from the erroneous empirical
  estimation of $\\mathcal{H}$-divergence with few source domain samples. To tackle
  this problem, we propose a double-head discriminator algorithm by introducing an
  addition source-only domain discriminator trained solely on the source learning
  phase. We prove that by introducing a pre-trained source-only domain discriminator,
  the empirical estimation error of $\\mathcal{H}$-divergence related adversarial
  loss is reduced from the source domain side. Further experiments on existing domain
  adaptation benchmarks show that our proposed algorithm achieves more than 2$%$ improvement
  on all categories of target domain adaptation tasks while significantly mitigating
  the forgetting of the source domain. "
