title: " Surrogate Active Subspaces for Jump-Discontinuous Functions "
software: " https://github.com/NathanWycoff/discont_active "
abstract: " Surrogate modeling and active subspaces have emerged as powerful paradigms
  in computational science and engineering. Porting such techniques to computational
  models in the social sciences brings into sharp relief their limitations in dealing
  with discontinuous simulators, such as Agent-Based Models, which have discrete outputs.
  Nevertheless, prior applied work has shown that surrogate estimates of active subspaces
  for such estimators can yield interesting results. But given that active subspaces
  are defined by way of gradients, it is not clear what quantity is being estimated
  when this methodology is applied to a discontinuous simulator. We begin this article
  by showing some pathologies that can arise when conducting such an analysis. This
  motivates an extension of active subspaces to discontinuous functions, clarifying
  what is actually being estimated in such analyses. We also conduct numerical experiments
  on synthetic test functions to compare Gaussian process estimates of active subspaces
  on continuous and discontinuous functions. Finally, we deploy our methodology on
  Flee, an agent-based model of refugee movement, yielding novel insights into which
  parameters of the simulation are most important across 8 displacement crises in
  Africa and the Middle East. "
