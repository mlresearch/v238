title: " Self-Compatibility: Evaluating Causal Discovery without Ground Truth "
software: " https://github.com/amazon-science/causal-self-compatibility "
abstract: " As causal ground truth is incredibly rare, causal discovery algorithms
  are commonly only evaluated on simulated data. This is concerning, given that simulations
  reflect preconceptions about generating processes regarding noise distributions,
  model classes, and more. In this work, we propose a novel method for falsifying
  the output of a causal discovery algorithm in the absence of ground truth. Our key
  insight is that while statistical learning seeks stability across subsets of data
  points, causal learning should seek stability across subsets of variables. Motivated
  by this insight, our method relies on a notion of compatibility between causal graphs
  learned on different subsets of variables. We prove that detecting incompatibilities
  can falsify wrongly inferred causal relations due to violation of assumptions or
  errors from finite sample effects. Although passing such compatibility tests is
  only a necessary criterion for good performance, we argue that it provides strong
  evidence for the causal models whenever compatibility entails strong implications
  for the joint distribution. We also demonstrate experimentally that detection of
  incompatibilities can aid in causal model selection. "
