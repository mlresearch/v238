title: " Fast Dynamic Sampling for Determinantal Point Processes "
abstract: " n this work, we provide fast dynamic algorithms for repeatedly sampling
  from distributions characterized by Determinantal Point Processes (DPPs) and Nonsymmetric
  Determinantal Point Processes (NDPPs). DPPs are a very well-studied class of distributions
  on subsets of items drawn from a ground set of cardinality $n$ characterized by
  a symmetric $n \\times n$ kernel matrix $L$ such that the probability of any subset
  is proportional to the determinant of its corresponding principal submatrix. Recent
  work has shown that the kernel symmetry constraint can be relaxed, leading to NDPPs,
  which can better model data in several machine learning applications. Given a low-rank
  kernel matrix ${\\cal L}=L+L^\\top\\in \\mathbb{R}^{n\\times n}$ and its corresponding
  eigendecomposition specified by $\\{\\lambda_i, u_i \\}_{i=1}^d$ where $d\\leq n$
  is the rank, we design a data structure that uses $O(nd)$ space and preprocesses
  data in $O(nd^{\\omega-1})$ time where $\\omega\\approx 2.37$ is the exponent of
  matrix multiplication. The data structure can generate a sample according to DPP
  distribution in time $O(|E|^3\\log n+|E|^{\\omega-1}d^2)$ or according to NDPP distribution
  in time $O((|E|^3 \\log n+ |E|^{\\omega-1}d^2)(1+w)^d)$ for $E$ being the sampled
  indices and $w$ is a data-dependent parameter. This improves upon the space and
  preprocessing time over prior works, and achieves a state-of-the-art sampling time
  when the sampling set is relatively dense. At the heart of our data structure is
  an efficient sampling tree that can leverage batch initialization and fast inner
  product query simultaneously. "
