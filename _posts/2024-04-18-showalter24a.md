title: " Bayesian Online Learning for Consensus Prediction "
software: " https://github.com/SamShowalter/bocp "
abstract: " Given a pre-trained classifier and multiple human experts, we investigate
  the task of online classification where model predictions are provided for free
  but querying humans incurs a cost. In this practical but under-explored setting,
  oracle ground truth is not available. Instead, the prediction target is defined
  as the consensus vote of all experts. Given that querying full consensus can be
  costly, we propose a general framework for online Bayesian consensus estimation,
  leveraging properties of the multivariate hypergeometric distribution. Based on
  this framework, we propose a family of methods that dynamically estimate expert
  consensus from partial feedback by producing a posterior over expert and model beliefs.
  Analyzing this posterior induces an interpretable trade-off between querying cost
  and classification performance. We demonstrate the efficacy of our framework against
  a variety of baselines on CIFAR-10H and ImageNet-16H, two large-scale crowdsourced
  datasets. "
