title: " MIM-Reasoner: Learning with Theoretical Guarantees for Multiplex Influence
  Maximization "
software: " https://github.com/nguyendohoangkhoiUF/MIM-Reasoner "
abstract: " Multiplex influence maximization (MIM) asks us to identify a set of seed
  users such as to maximize the expected number of influenced users in a multiplex
  network. MIM has been one of central research topics, especially in nowadays social
  networking landscape where users participate in multiple online social networks
  (OSNs) and their influences can propagate among several OSNs simultaneously. Although
  there exist a couple combinatorial algorithms to MIM, learning-based solutions have
  been desired due to its generalization ability to heterogeneous networks and their
  diversified propagation characteristics. In this paper, we introduce MIM-Reasoner,
  coupling reinforcement learning with probabilistic graphical model, which effectively
  captures the complex propagation process within and between layers of a given multiplex
  network, thereby tackling the most challenging problem in MIM. We establish a theoretical
  guarantee for MIM-Reasoner as well as conduct extensive analyses on both synthetic
  and real-world datasets to validate our MIM-Reasoner’s performance. "
