title: " Near-optimal Per-Action Regret Bounds for Sleeping Bandits "
abstract: " We derive near-optimal per-action regret bounds for sleeping bandits,
  in which both the sets of available arms and their losses in every round are chosen
  by an adversary. In a setting with $K$ total arms and at most $A$ available arms
  in each round over $T$ rounds, the best known upper bound is $O(K\\sqrt{TA\\ln{K}})$,
  obtained indirectly via minimizing internal sleeping regrets. Compared to the minimax
  $\\Omega(\\sqrt{TA})$ lower bound, this upper bound contains an extra multiplicative
  factor of $K\\ln{K}$. We address this gap by directly minimizing the per-action
  regret using generalized versions of EXP3, EXP3-IX and FTRL with Tsallis entropy,
  thereby obtaining near-optimal bounds of order $O(\\sqrt{TA\\ln{K}})$ and $O(\\sqrt{T\\sqrt{AK}})$.
  We extend our results to the setting of bandits with advice from sleeping experts,
  generalizing EXP4 along the way. This leads to new proofs for a number of existing
  adaptive and tracking regret bounds for standard non-sleeping bandits. Extending
  our results to the bandit version of experts that report their confidences leads
  to new bounds for the confidence regret that depends primarily on the sum of experts’
  confidences. We prove a lower bound, showing that for any minimax optimal algorithms,
  there exists an action whose regret is sublinear in $T$ but linear in the number
  of its active rounds. "
