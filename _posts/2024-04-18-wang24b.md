title: " On Counterfactual Metrics for Social Welfare: Incentives, Ranking, and Information
  Asymmetry "
software: " https://github.com/serenalwang/counterfactual_metrics "
abstract: " From the social sciences to machine learning, it is well documented that
  metrics do not always align with social welfare. In healthcare, Dranove et al. (2003)
  showed that publishing surgery mortality metrics actually harmed sicker patients
  by increasing provider selection behavior. Using a principal-agent model, we analyze
  the incentive misalignments that arise from such average treated outcome metrics,
  and show that the incentives driving treatment decisions would align with maximizing
  total patient welfare if the metrics (i) accounted for counterfactual untreated
  outcomes and (ii) considered total welfare instead of averaging over treated patients.
  Operationalizing this, we show how counterfactual metrics can be modified to behave
  reasonably in patient-facing ranking systems. Extending to realistic settings when
  providers observe more about patients than the regulatory agencies do, we bound
  the decay in performance by the degree of information asymmetry between principal
  and agent. In doing so, our model connects principal-agent information asymmetry
  with unobserved heterogeneity in causal inference. "
