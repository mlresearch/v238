title: " Improved Algorithm for Adversarial Linear Mixture MDPs with Bandit Feedback
  and Unknown Transition "
abstract: " We study reinforcement learning with linear function approximation, unknown
  transition, and adversarial losses in the bandit feedback setting. Specifically,
  we focus on linear mixture MDPs whose transition kernel is a linear mixture model.
  We propose a new algorithm that attains an $\\tilde{\\mathcal{O}}(d\\sqrt{HS^3K}
  + \\sqrt{HSAK})$ regret with high probability, where $d$ is the dimension of feature
  mappings, $S$ is the size of state space, $A$ is the size of action space, $H$ is
  the episode length and $K$ is the number of episodes. Our result strictly improves
  the previous best-known $\\tilde{\\mathcal{O}}(dS^2 \\sqrt{K} + \\sqrt{HSAK})$ result
  in Zhao et al. (2023a) since $H \\leq S$ holds by the layered MDP structure. Our
  advancements are primarily attributed to (\\romannumeral1) a new least square estimator
  for the transition parameter that leverages the visit information of all states,
  as opposed to only one state in prior work, and (\\romannumeral2) a new self-normalized
  concentration tailored specifically to handle non-independent noises, originally
  proposed in the dynamic assortment area and firstly applied in reinforcement learning
  to handle correlations between different states. "
