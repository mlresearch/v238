software: " https://github.com/lzt68/BAI-Resource-Constraint-AISTATS2024-Camera-Ready "
abstract: " Motivated by the cost heterogeneity in experimentation across different
  alternatives, we study the Best Arm Identification with Resource Constraints (BAIwRC)
  problem. The agent aims to identify the best arm under resource constraints, where
  resources are consumed for each arm pull. We make two novel contributions. We design
  and analyze the Successive Halving with Resource Rationing algorithm (SH-RR). The
  SH-RR achieves a near-optimal non-asymptotic rate of convergence in terms of the
  probability of successively identifying an optimal arm. Interestingly, we identify
  a difference in convergence rates between the cases of deterministic and stochastic
  resource consumption. "
