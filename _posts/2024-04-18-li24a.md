title: " Personalized Federated X-armed Bandit "
abstract: " In this work, we study the personalized federated $\\mathcal{X}$-armed
  bandit problem, where the heterogeneous local objectives of the clients are optimized
  simultaneously in the federated learning paradigm. We propose the \\texttt{PF-PNE}
  algorithm with a unique double elimination strategy, which safely eliminates the
  non-optimal regions while encouraging federated collaboration through biased but
  effective evaluations of the local objectives. The proposed \\texttt{PF-PNE} algorithm
  is able to optimize local objectives with arbitrary levels of heterogeneity, and
  its limited communications protects the confidentiality of the client-wise reward
  data. Our theoretical analysis shows the benefit of the proposed algorithm over
  single-client algorithms. Experimentally, \\texttt{PF-PNE} outperforms multiple
  baselines on both synthetic and real life datasets. "
