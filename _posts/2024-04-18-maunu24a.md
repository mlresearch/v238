title: " Acceleration and Implicit Regularization in Gaussian Phase Retrieval "
software: " https://github.com/twmaunu/accelerated-phase-retrieval "
abstract: " We study accelerated optimization methods in the Gaussian phase retrieval
  problem. In this setting, we prove that gradient methods with Polyak or Nesterov
  momentum have similar implicit regularization to gradient descent. This implicit
  regularization ensures that the algorithms remain in a nice region, where the cost
  function is strongly convex and smooth despite being nonconvex in general. This
  ensures that these accelerated methods achieve faster rates of convergence than
  gradient descent. Experimental evidence demonstrates that the accelerated methods
  converge faster than gradient descent in practice. "
