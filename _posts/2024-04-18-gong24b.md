title: " Towards Practical Non-Adversarial Distribution Matching "
software: " https://github.com/inouye-lab/VAUB.git "
abstract: " Distribution matching can be used to learn invariant representations with
  applications in fairness and robustness. Most prior works resort to adversarial
  matching methods but the resulting minimax problems are unstable and challenging
  to optimize. Non-adversarial likelihood-based approaches either require model invertibility,
  impose constraints on the latent prior, or lack a generic framework for distribution
  matching. To overcome these limitations, we propose a non-adversarial VAE-based
  matching method that can be applied to any model pipeline. We develop a set of alignment
  upper bounds for distribution matching (including a noisy bound) that have VAE-like
  objectives but with a different perspective. We carefully compare our method to
  prior VAE-based matching approaches both theoretically and empirically. Finally,
  we demonstrate that our novel matching losses can replace adversarial losses in
  standard invariant representation learning pipelines without modifying the original
  architectures—thereby significantly broadening the applicability of non-adversarial
  matching methods. "
