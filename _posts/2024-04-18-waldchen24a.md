title: " Interpretability Guarantees with Merlin-Arthur Classifiers "
software: " https://github.com/ZIB-IOL/merlin-arthur-classifiers "
abstract: " We propose an interactive multi-agent classifier that provides provable
  interpretability guarantees even for complex agents such as neural networks. These
  guarantees consist of lower bounds on the mutual information between selected features
  and the classification decision. Our results are inspired by the Merlin-Arthur protocol
  from Interactive Proof Systems and express these bounds in terms of measurable metrics
  such as soundness and completeness. Compared to existing interactive setups, we
  rely neither on optimal agents nor on the assumption that features are distributed
  independently. Instead, we use the relative strength of the agents as well as the
  new concept of Asymmetric Feature Correlation which captures the precise kind of
  correlations that make interpretability guarantees difficult. We evaluate our results
  on two small-scale datasets where high mutual information can be verified explicitly. "
