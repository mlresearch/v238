title: " Robust Approximate Sampling via Stochastic Gradient Barker Dynamics "
software: " https://github.com/maurilorenzo/sgbd "
abstract: " Stochastic Gradient (SG) Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithms (MCMC) are
  popular algorithms for Bayesian sampling in the presence of large datasets. However,
  they come with little theoretical guarantees and assessing their empirical performances
  is non-trivial. In such context, it is crucial to develop algorithms that are robust
  to the choice of hyperparameters and to gradients heterogeneity since, in practice,
  both the choice of step-size and behaviour of target gradients induce hard-to-control
  biases in the invariant distribution. In this work we introduce the stochastic gradient
  Barker dynamics (SGBD) algorithm, extending the recently developed Barker MCMC scheme,
  a robust alternative to Langevin-based sampling algorithms, to the stochastic gradient
  framework. We characterize the impact of stochastic gradients on the Barker transition
  mechanism and develop a bias-corrected version that, under suitable assumptions,
  eliminates the error due to the gradient noise in the proposal. We illustrate the
  performance on a number of high-dimensional examples, showing that SGBD is more
  robust to hyperparameter tuning and to irregular behavior of the target gradients
  compared to the popular stochastic gradient Langevin dynamics algorithm. "
