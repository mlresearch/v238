  minimization "

abstract: " Quantifying the difference between two probability density functions,
  $p$ and $q$, using available data, is a fundamental problem in Statistics and Machine
  Learning. A usual approach for addressing this problem is the likelihood-ratio estimation
  (LRE) between $p$ and $q$, which -to our best knowledge- has been investigated mainly
  for the offline case. This paper contributes by introducing a new framework for
  online non-parametric LRE (OLRE) for the setting where pairs of iid observations
  $(x_t \\sim p, x’_t \\sim q)$ are observed over time. The non-parametric nature
  of our approach has the advantage of being agnostic to the forms of $p$ and $q$.
  Moreover, we capitalize on the recent advances in Kernel Methods and functional
  minimization to develop an estimator that can be efficiently updated at every iteration.
  We provide theoretical guarantees for the performance of the OLRE method along with
  empirical validation in synthetic experiments. "
