title: " Multi-Level Symbolic Regression: Function Structure Learning for Multi-Level
  Data "
software: " https://github.com/kentridgeai/MSR-Supplementary "
abstract: " Symbolic Regression (SR) is an approach which learns a closed-form function
  relating the predictors to the outcome in a dataset. Datasets are often multi-level
  (MuL), meaning that certain features can be used to split data into groups for analysis
  (we refer to these features as levels). The advantage of viewing datasets as MuL
  is that we can exploit the high similarity of data within a group. SR is well-suited
  for MuL datasets, in which the learnt function structure serves as ‘shared information’
  between the groups while the learnt parameter values capture the unique relationships
  within each group. In this context, this paper makes three contributions: (i) We
  design an algorithm, Multi-level Symbolic Regression (MSR), which runs multiple
  parallel SR processes for each group and merges them to produce a single function
  structure. (ii) To tackle datasets that are not explicitly MuL, we develop a metric
  termed MLICC to select the best feature to serve as a level. (iii) We also release
  MSRBench, a database of MuL datasets (synthetic and real-world) which we developed
  and collated, that can be used to evaluate MSR. Our results and ablation studies
  demonstrate that MSR achieves a higher recovery rate and lower error on MSRBench
  compared to SOTA methods for SR and MuL datasets. "
