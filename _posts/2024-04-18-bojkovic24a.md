abstract: " Spiking neural networks (SNNs) present an increasingly popular alternative
  to artificial neural networks (ANNs), due to their energy and time efficiency when
  deployed on neuromorphic hardware. However, due to their discrete and highly non-differentiable
  nature, training SNNs is a challenging task and remains an active area of research.
  Some of the most prominent ways to train SNNs are based on ANN-to-SNN conversion
  where an SNN model is initialized with parameters from the corresponding, pre-trained
  ANN model. SNN models trained through ANN-to-SNN conversion or hybrid training show
  state of the art performance among SNNs on many machine learning tasks, comparable
  to those of ANNs. However, the top performing models need high latency or tailored
  ANNs to perform well, and in general are not using the full information available
  from ANNs. In this work, we propose novel method to initialize SNN’s thresholds
  and initial membrane potential after ANN-to-SNN conversion, using distributions
  of ANN’s activation values. We provide a theoretical framework for feature distribution-based
  conversion error, providing theoretical results on optimal membrane initialization
  and thresholds which minimize this error, as well as a practical algorithm for finding
  these optimal values. We test our method, both as a stand-alone ANN-to-SNN conversion
  and in combination with other methods, and show state of the art results on high-dimensional
  datasets such as CIFAR10, CIFAR100 and ImageNet and various architectures. Our code
