title: " Queuing dynamics of asynchronous Federated Learning "
abstract: " We study asynchronous federated learning mechanisms with nodes having
  potentially different computational speeds. In such an environment, each node is
  allowed to work on models with potential delays and contribute to updates to the
  central server at its own pace. Existing analyses of such algorithms typically depend
  on intractable quantities such as the maximum node delay and do not consider the
  underlying queuing dynamics of the system. In this paper, we propose a non-uniform
  sampling scheme for the central server that allows for lower delays with better
  complexity, taking into account the closed Jackson network structure of the associated
  computational graph. Our experiments clearly show a significant improvement of our
  method over current state-of-the-art asynchronous algorithms on image classification
  problems. "
