title: " Restricted Isometry Property of Rank-One Measurements with Random Unit-Modulus
  Vectors "
abstract: " The restricted isometry property (RIP) is essential for the linear map
  to guarantee the successful recovery of low-rank matrices. The existing works show
  that the linear map generated by the measurement matrices with independent and identically
  distributed (i.i.d.) entries satisfies RIP with high probability. However, when
  dealing with non-i.i.d. measurement matrices, such as the rank-one measurements,
  the RIP compliance may not be guaranteed. In this paper, we show that the RIP can
  still be achieved with high probability, when the rank-one measurement matrix is
  constructed by the random unit-modulus vectors. Compared to the existing works,
  we first address the challenge of establishing RIP for the linear map in non-i.i.d.
  scenarios. As validated in the experiments, this linear map is memory-efficient,
  and not only satisfies the RIP but also exhibits similar recovery performance of
  the low-rank matrices to that of conventional i.i.d. measurement matrices. "
