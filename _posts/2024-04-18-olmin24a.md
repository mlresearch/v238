title: " On the connection between Noise-Contrastive Estimation and Contrastive Divergence "
software: " https://github.com/jackonelli/nce_cd_cis/tree/test_merge "
abstract: " Noise-contrastive estimation (NCE) is a popular method for estimating
  unnormalised probabilistic models, such as energy-based models, which are effective
  for modelling complex data distributions. Unlike classical maximum likelihood (ML)
  estimation that relies on importance sampling (resulting in ML-IS) or MCMC (resulting
  in contrastive divergence, CD), NCE uses a proxy criterion to avoid the need for
  evaluating an often intractable normalisation constant. Despite apparent conceptual
  differences, we show that two NCE criteria, ranking NCE (RNCE) and conditional NCE
  (CNCE), can be viewed as ML estimation methods. Specifically, RNCE is equivalent
  to ML estimation combined with conditional importance sampling, and both RNCE and
  CNCE are special cases of CD. These findings bridge the gap between the two method
  classes and allow us to apply techniques from the ML-IS and CD literature to NCE,
  offering several advantageous extensions. "
