title: " Efficient Data Shapley for Weighted Nearest Neighbor Algorithms "
abstract: " This work aims to address an open problem in data valuation literature
  concerning the efficient computation of Data Shapley for weighted $K$ nearest neighbor
  algorithm (WKNN-Shapley). By considering the accuracy of hard-label KNN with discretized
  weights as the utility function, we reframe the computation of WKNN-Shapley into
  a counting problem and introduce a quadratic-time algorithm, presenting a notable
  improvement from $O(N^K)$, the best result from existing literature. We develop
  a deterministic approximation algorithm that further improves computational efficiency
  while maintaining the key fairness properties of the Shapley value. Through extensive
  experiments, we demonstrate WKNN-Shapley’s computational efficiency and its superior
  performance in discerning data quality compared to its unweighted counterpart. "
