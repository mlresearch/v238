title: " Sequence Length Independent Norm-Based Generalization Bounds for Transformers "
software: " https://github.com/traugerjacob/Transformer-Gen-Bounds "
abstract: " This paper provides norm-based generalization bounds for the Transformer
  architecture that do not depend on the input sequence length. We employ a covering
  number based approach to prove our bounds. We use three novel covering number bounds
  for the function class of bounded linear mappings to upper bound the Rademacher
  complexity of the Transformer. Furthermore, we show this generalization bound applies
  to the common Transformer training technique of masking and then predicting the
  masked word. We also run a simulated study on a sparse majority data set that empirically
  validates our theoretical findings. "
