title: " Score Operator Newton transport "
software: " https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.10307262 "
abstract: " We propose a new approach for sampling and Bayesian computation that uses
  the score of the target distribution to construct a transport from a given reference
  distribution to the target. Our approach is an infinite-dimensional Newton method,
  involving an elliptic PDE, for finding a zero of a “score-residual” operator. We
  prove sufficient conditions for convergence to a valid transport map. Our Newton
  iterates can be computed by exploiting fast solvers for elliptic PDEs, resulting
  in new algorithms for Bayesian inference and other sampling tasks. We identify elementary
  settings where score-operator Newton transport achieves fast convergence while avoiding
  mode collapse. "
