title: " Contextual Directed Acyclic Graphs "
software: " https://github.com/ryan-thompson/contextual-directed-acyclic-graphs "
abstract: ' Estimating the structure of directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) from observational
  data remains a significant challenge in machine learning. Most research in this
  area concentrates on learning a single DAG for the entire population. This paper
  considers an alternative setting where the graph structure varies across individuals
  based on available "contextual" features. We tackle this contextual DAG problem
  via a neural network that maps the contextual features to a DAG, represented as
  a weighted adjacency matrix. The neural network is equipped with a novel projection
  layer that ensures the output matrices are sparse and satisfy a recently developed
  characterization of acyclicity. We devise a scalable computational framework for
  learning contextual DAGs and provide a convergence guarantee and an analytical gradient
  for backpropagating through the projection layer. Our experiments suggest that the
  new approach can recover the true context-specific graph where existing approaches
  fail. '
