title: " Near-Optimal Pure Exploration in Matrix Games: A Generalization of Stochastic
  Bandits & Dueling Bandits "
abstract: " We study the sample complexity of identifying the pure strategy Nash equilibrium
  (PSNE) in a two-player zero-sum matrix game with noise. Formally, we are given a
  stochastic model where any learner can sample an entry $(i,j)$ of the input matrix
  $A\\in [-1,1]^{n\\times m}$ and observe $A_{i,j}+\\eta$ where $\\eta$ is a zero-mean
  $1$-sub-Gaussian noise. The aim of the learner is to identify the PSNE of $A$, whenever
  it exists, with high probability while taking as few samples as possible. Zhou et
  al., (2017) presents an instance-dependent sample complexity lower bound that depends
  only on the entries in the row and column in which the PSNE lies. We design a near-optimal
  algorithm whose sample complexity matches the lower bound, up to log factors. The
  problem of identifying the PSNE also generalizes the problem of pure exploration
  in stochastic multi-armed bandits and dueling bandits, and our result matches the
  optimal bounds, up to log factors, in both the settings. "
