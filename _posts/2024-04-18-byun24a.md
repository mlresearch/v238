title: " Auditing Fairness under Unobserved Confounding "
software: " https://github.com/lasilab/inequity-bounds "
abstract: " A fundamental problem in decision-making systems is the presence of inequity
  along demographic lines. However, inequity can be difficult to quantify, particularly
  if our notion of equity relies on hard-to-measure notions like risk (e.g., equal
  access to treatment for those who would die without it). Auditing such inequity
  requires accurate measurements of individual risk, which is difficult to estimate
  in the realistic setting of unobserved confounding. In the case that these unobservables
  “explain” an apparent disparity, we may understate or overstate inequity. In this
  paper, we show that one can still give informative bounds on allocation rates among
  high-risk individuals, even while relaxing or (surprisingly) even when eliminating
  the assumption that all relevant risk factors are observed. We utilize the fact
  that in many real-world settings (e.g., the introduction of a novel treatment) we
  have data from a period prior to any allocation, to derive unbiased estimates of
  risk. We apply our framework to a real-world setting of Paxlovid allocation to COVID-19
  patients, finding that observed racial inequity cannot be explained by unobserved
  confounders of the same strength as important observed covariates. "
