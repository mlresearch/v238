title: " Implicit Regularization in Deep Tucker Factorization: Low-Rankness via Structured
  Sparsity "
software: " https://github.com/Stef-hub/deeptuckerimplicit "
abstract: " We theoretically analyze the implicit regularization of deep learning
  for tensor completion. We show that deep Tucker factorization trained by gradient
  descent induces a structured sparse regularization. This leads to a characterization
  of the effect of the depth of the neural network on the implicit regularization
  and provides a potential explanation for the bias of gradient descent towards solutions
  with low multilinear rank. Numerical experiments confirm our theoretical findings
  and give insights into the behavior of gradient descent in deep tensor factorization. "
