title: " Theoretically Grounded Loss Functions and Algorithms for Score-Based Multi-Class
  Abstention "
abstract: " Learning with abstention is a key scenario where the learner can abstain
  from making a prediction at some cost. In this paper, we analyze the score-based
  formulation of learning with abstention in the multi-class classification setting.
  We introduce new families of surrogate losses for the abstention loss function,
  which include the state-of-the-art surrogate losses in the single-stage setting
  and a novel family of loss functions in the two-stage setting. We prove strong non-asymptotic
  and hypothesis set-specific consistency guarantees for these surrogate losses, which
  upper-bound the estimation error of the abstention loss function in terms of the
  estimation error of the surrogate loss. Our bounds can help compare different score-based
  surrogates and guide the design of novel abstention algorithms by minimizing the
  proposed surrogate losses. We experimentally evaluate our new algorithms on CIFAR-10,
  CIFAR-100, and SVHN datasets and the practical significance of our new surrogate
  losses and two-stage abstention algorithms. Our results also show that the relative
  performance of the state-of-the-art score-based surrogate losses can vary across
  datasets. "
