title: " Adaptivity of Diffusion Models to Manifold Structures "
abstract: " Empirical studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of (score-based)
  diffusion models in generating high-dimensional data, such as texts and images,
  which typically exhibit a low-dimensional manifold nature. These empirical successes
  raise the theoretical question of whether score-based diffusion models can optimally
  adapt to low-dimensional manifold structures. While recent work has validated the
  minimax optimality of diffusion models when the target distribution admits a smooth
  density with respect to the Lebesgue measure of the ambient data space, these findings
  do not fully account for the ability of diffusion models in avoiding the the curse
  of dimensionality when estimating high-dimensional distributions. This work considers
  two common classes of diffusion models: Langevin diffusion and forward-backward
  diffusion. We show that both models can adapt to the intrinsic manifold structure
  by showing that the convergence rate of the inducing distribution estimator depends
  only on the intrinsic dimension of the data. Moreover, our considered estimator
  does not require knowing or explicitly estimating the manifold. We also demonstrate
  that the forward-backward diffusion can achieve the minimax optimal rate under the
  Wasserstein metric when the target distribution possesses a smooth density with
  respect to the volume measure of the low-dimensional manifold. "
