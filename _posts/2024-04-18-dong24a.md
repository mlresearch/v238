title: " Convergence to Nash Equilibrium and No-regret Guarantee in (Markov) Potential
  Games "
software: " https://github.com/jingdong00/potential_game_exp "
abstract: " In this work, we study potential games and Markov potential games under
  stochastic cost and bandit feedback. We propose a variant of the Frank-Wolfe algorithm
  with sufficient exploration and recursive gradient estimation, which provably converges
  to the Nash equilibrium while attaining sublinear regret for each individual player.
  Our algorithm simultaneously achieves a Nash regret and a regret bound of $O(T^{4/5})$
  for potential games, which matches the best available result, without using additional
  projection steps. Through carefully balancing the reuse of past samples and exploration
  of new samples, we then extend the results to Markov potential games and improve
  the best available Nash regret from $O(T^{5/6})$ to $O(T^{4/5})$. Moreover, our
  algorithm requires no knowledge of the game, such as the distribution mismatch coefficient,
  which provides more flexibility in its practical implementation. Experimental results
  corroborate our theoretical findings and underscore the practical effectiveness
  of our method. "
