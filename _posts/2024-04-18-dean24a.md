abstract: " Numerous online services are data-driven: the behavior of users affects
  the system’s parameters, and the system’s parameters affect the users’ experience
  of the service, which in turn affects the way users may interact with the system.
  For example, people may choose to use a service only for tasks that already works
  well, or they may choose to switch to a different service. These adaptations influence
  the ability of a system to learn about a population of users and tasks in order
  to improve its performance broadly. In this work, we analyze a class of such dynamics—where
  users allocate their participation amongst services to reduce the individual risk
  they experience, and services update their model parameters to reduce the service’s
  risk on their current user population. We refer to these dynamics as \\emph{risk-reducing},
  which cover a broad class of common model updates including gradient descent and
  multiplicative weights. For this general class of dynamics, we show that asymptotically
  stable equilibria are always segmented, with sub-populations allocated to a single
  learner. Under mild assumptions, the utilitarian social optimum is a stable equilibrium.
  In contrast to previous work, which shows that repeated risk minimization can result
  in representation disparity and high overall loss with a single learner (Hashimoto
  et al., 2018; Miller et al., 2021), we find that repeated myopic updates with multiple
  learners lead to better outcomes. We illustrate the phenomena via a simulated example
  initialized from real data. "
