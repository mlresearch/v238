title: " Linear Convergence of Black-Box Variational Inference: Should We Stick the
  Landing? "
abstract: " We prove that black-box variational inference (BBVI) with control variates,
  particularly the sticking-the-landing (STL) estimator, converges at a geometric
  (traditionally called “linear”) rate under perfect variational family specification.
  In particular, we prove a quadratic bound on the gradient variance of the STL estimator,
  one which encompasses misspecified variational families. Combined with previous
  works on the quadratic variance condition, this directly implies convergence of
  BBVI with the use of projected stochastic gradient descent. For the projection operator,
  we consider a domain with triangular scale matrices, which the projection onto is
  computable in $\\theta(d)$ time, where $d$ is the dimensionality of the target posterior.
  We also improve existing analysis on the regular closed-form entropy gradient estimators,
  which enables comparison against the STL estimator, providing explicit non-asymptotic
  complexity guarantees for both. "
