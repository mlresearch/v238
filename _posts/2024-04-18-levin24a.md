title: " Any-dimensional equivariant neural networks "
software: " https://github.com/mateodd25/free-nets "
abstract: " Traditional supervised learning aims to learn an unknown mapping by fitting
  a function to a set of input-output pairs with a fixed dimension. The fitted function
  is then defined on inputs of the same dimension. However, in many settings, the
  unknown mapping takes inputs in any dimension; examples include graph parameters
  defined on graphs of any size and physics quantities defined on an arbitrary number
  of particles. We leverage a newly-discovered phenomenon in algebraic topology, called
  representation stability, to define equivariant neural networks that can be trained
  with data in a fixed dimension and then extended to accept inputs in any dimension.
  Our approach is black-box and user-friendly, requiring only the network architecture
  and the groups for equivariance, and can be combined with any training procedure.
  We provide a simple open-source implementation of our methods and offer preliminary
  numerical experiments. "
