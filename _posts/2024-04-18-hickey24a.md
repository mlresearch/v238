title: " Adaptive Discretization for Event PredicTion (ADEPT) "
software: " https://github.com/JimmyJHickey/ADEPT "
abstract: " Recently developed survival analysis methods improve upon existing approaches
  by predicting the probability of event occurrence in each of a number pre-specified
  (discrete) time intervals. By avoiding placing strong parametric assumptions on
  the event density, this approach tends to improve prediction performance, particularly
  when data are plentiful. However, in clinical settings with limited available data,
  it is often preferable to judiciously partition the event time space into a limited
  number of intervals well suited to the prediction task at hand. In this work, we
  develop Adaptive Discretization for Event PredicTion (ADEPT) to learn from data
  a set of cut points defining such a partition. We show that in two simulated datasets,
  we are able to recover intervals that match the underlying generative model. We
  then demonstrate improved prediction performance on three real-world observational
  datasets, including a large, newly harmonized stroke risk prediction dataset. Finally,
  we argue that our approach facilitates clinical decision-making by suggesting time
  intervals that are most appropriate for each task, in the sense that they facilitate
  more accurate risk prediction. "
