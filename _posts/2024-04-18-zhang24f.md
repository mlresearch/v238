title: " Online Learning in Contextual Second-Price Pay-Per-Click Auctions "
abstract: " We study online learning in contextual pay-per-click auctions where at
  each of the $T$ rounds, the learner receives some context along with a set of ads
  and needs to make an estimate on their click-through rate (CTR) in order to run
  a second-price pay-per-click auction. The learner’s goal is to minimize her regret,
  defined as the gap between her total revenue and that of an oracle strategy that
  always makes perfect CTR predictions. We first show that $\\sqrt{T}$-regret is obtainable
  via a computationally inefficient algorithm and that it is unavoidable since our
  algorithm is no easier than the classical multi-armed bandit problem. A by-product
  of our results is a $\\sqrt{T}$-regret bound for the simpler non-contextual setting,
  improving upon a recent work of [Feng et al., 2023] by removing the inverse CTR
  dependency that could be arbitrarily large. Then, borrowing ideas from recent advances
  on efficient contextual bandit algorithms, we develop two practically efficient
  contextual auction algorithms: the first one uses the exponential weight scheme
  with optimistic square errors and maintains the same $\\sqrt{T}$-regret bound, while
  the second one reduces the problem to online regression via a simple epsilon-greedy
  strategy, albeit with a worse regret bound. Finally, we conduct experiments on a
  synthetic dataset to showcase the effectiveness and superior performance of our
  algorithms. "
