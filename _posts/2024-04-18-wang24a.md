title: " Oracle-Efficient Pessimism: Offline Policy Optimization In Contextual Bandits "
software: " https://github.com/LequnWang/pseudo-loss-for-offline-policy-learning "
abstract: " We consider offline policy optimization (OPO) in contextual bandits, where
  one is given a fixed dataset of logged interactions. While pessimistic regularizers
  are typically used to mitigate distribution shift, prior implementations thereof
  are either specialized or computationally inefficient. We present the first \\emph{general}
  oracle-efficient algorithm for pessimistic OPO: it reduces to supervised learning,
  leading to broad applicability. We obtain statistical guarantees analogous to those
  for prior pessimistic approaches. We instantiate our approach for both discrete
  and continuous actions and perform experiments in both settings, showing advantage
  over unregularized OPO across a wide range of configurations. "
