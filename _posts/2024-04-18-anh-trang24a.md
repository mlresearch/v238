software: " https://github.com/HySonLab/EquiMesh "
abstract: " Triangular meshes are widely used to represent three-dimensional objects.
  As a result, many recent works have addressed the need for geometric deep learning
  on 3D meshes. However, we observe that the complexities in many of these architectures
  do not translate to practical performance, and simple deep models for geometric
  graphs are competitive in practice. Motivated by this observation, we minimally
  extend the update equations of E(n)-Equivariant Graph Neural Networks (EGNNs) (Satorras
  et al., 2021) to incorporate mesh face information and further improve it to account
  for long-range interactions through a hierarchy. The resulting architecture, Equivariant
  Mesh Neural Network (EMNN), outperforms other, more complicated equivariant methods
  on mesh tasks, with a fast run-time and no expensive preprocessing. Our implementation
  is available at \\url{https://github.com/HySonLab/EquiMesh}. "
