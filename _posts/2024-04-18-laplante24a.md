title: " Conditional Adjustment in a Markov Equivalence Class "
abstract: " We consider the problem of identifying a conditional causal effect through
  covariate adjustment. We focus on the setting where the causal graph is known up
  to one of two types of graphs: a maximally oriented partially directed acyclic graph
  (MPDAG) or a partial ancestral graph (PAG). Both MPDAGs and PAGs represent equivalence
  classes of possible underlying causal models. After defining adjustment sets in
  this setting, we provide a necessary and sufficient graphical criterion – the conditional
  adjustment criterion – for finding these sets under conditioning on variables unaffected
  by treatment. We further provide explicit sets from the graph that satisfy the conditional
  adjustment criterion, and therefore, can be used as adjustment sets for conditional
  causal effect identification. "
