title: " Scalable Learning of Item Response Theory Models "
software: " https://github.com/Tim907/IRT "
abstract: " Item Response Theory (IRT) models aim to assess latent abilities of $n$
  examinees along with latent difficulty characteristics of $m$ test items from categorical
  data that indicates the quality of their corresponding answers. Classical psychometric
  assessments are based on a relatively small number of examinees and items, say a
  class of $200$ students solving an exam comprising $10$ problems. More recent global
  large scale assessments such as PISA, or internet studies, may lead to significantly
  increased numbers of participants. Additionally, in the context of Machine Learning
  where algorithms take the role of examinees and data analysis problems take the
  role of items, both $n$ and $m$ may become very large, challenging the efficiency
  and scalability of computations. To learn the latent variables in IRT models from
  large data, we leverage the similarity of these models to logistic regression, which
  can be approximated accurately using small weighted subsets called coresets. We
  develop coresets for their use in alternating IRT training algorithms, facilitating
  scalable learning from large data. "
