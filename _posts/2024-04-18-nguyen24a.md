title: " On Parameter Estimation in Deviated Gaussian Mixture of Experts "
abstract: " We consider the parameter estimation problem in the deviated Gaussian
  mixture of experts in which the data are generated from $(1 - \\lambda^{\\ast})
  g_0(Y| X)+ \\lambda^{\\ast} \\sum_{i = 1}^{k_{\\ast}} p_{i}^{\\ast} f(Y|(a_{i}^{\\ast})^{\\top}X+b_i^{\\ast},\\sigma_{i}^{\\ast})$,
  where $X, Y$ are respectively a covariate vector and a response variable, $g_{0}(Y|X)$
  is a known function, $\\lambda^{\\ast} \\in [0, 1]$ is true but unknown mixing proportion,
  and $(p_{i}^{\\ast}, a_{i}^{\\ast}, b_{i}^{\\ast}, \\sigma_{i}^{\\ast})$ for $1
  \\leq i \\leq k^{\\ast}$ are unknown parameters of the Gaussian mixture of experts.
  This problem arises from the goodness-of-fit test when we would like to test whether
  the data are generated from $g_{0}(Y|X)$ (null hypothesis) or they are generated
  from the whole mixture (alternative hypothesis). Based on the algebraic structure
  of the expert functions and the distinguishability between $g_0$ and the mixture
  part, we construct novel Voronoi-based loss functions to capture the convergence
  rates of maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) for our models. We further demonstrate
  that our proposed loss functions characterize the local convergence rates of parameter
  estimation more accurately than the generalized Wasserstein, a loss function being
  commonly used for estimating parameters in the Gaussian mixture of experts. "
