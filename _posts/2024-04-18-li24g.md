title: " When No-Rejection Learning is Consistent for Regression with Rejection "
software: " https://github.com/hanzhao-wang/RwR "
abstract: " Learning with rejection has been a prototypical model for studying the
  human-AI interaction on prediction tasks. Upon the arrival of a sample instance,
  the model first uses a rejector to decide whether to accept and use the AI predictor
  to make a prediction or reject and defer the sample to humans. Learning such a model
  changes the structure of the original loss function and often results in undesirable
  non-convexity and inconsistency issues. For the classification with rejection problem,
  several works develop consistent surrogate losses for the joint learning of the
  predictor and the rejector, while there have been fewer works for the regression
  counterpart. This paper studies the regression with rejection (RwR) problem and
  investigates a no-rejection learning strategy that uses all the data to learn the
  predictor. We first establish the consistency for such a strategy under the weak
  realizability condition. Then for the case without the weak realizability, we show
  that the excessive risk can also be upper bounded with the sum of two parts: prediction
  error and calibration error. Lastly, we demonstrate the advantage of such a proposed
  learning strategy with empirical evidence. "
