title: " Coreset Markov chain Monte Carlo "
software: " https://github.com/NaitongChen/coreset-mcmc-experiments "
abstract: " A Bayesian coreset is a small, weighted subset of data that replaces the
  full dataset during inference in order to reduce computational cost. However, state
  of the art methods for tuning coreset weights are expensive, require nontrivial
  user input, and impose constraints on the model. In this work, we propose a new
  method—coreset MCMC—that simulates a Markov chain targeting the coreset posterior,
  while simultaneously updating the coreset weights using those same draws. Coreset
  MCMC is simple to implement and tune, and can be used with any existing MCMC kernel.
  We analyze coreset MCMC in a representative setting to obtain key insights about
  the convergence behaviour of the method. Empirical results demonstrate that coreset
  MCMC provides higher quality posterior approximations and reduced computational
  cost compared with other coreset construction methods. Further, compared with other
  general subsampling MCMC methods, we find that coreset MCMC has a higher sampling
  efficiency with competitively accurate posterior approximations. "
