title: " DHMConv: Directed Hypergraph Momentum Convolution Framework "
software: " https://github.com/WBZhao98/DHMConv "
abstract: " Due to its capability to capture high-order information, the hypergraph
  model has shown greater potential than the graph model in various scenarios. Real-world
  entity relations frequently involve directionality, in order to express high-order
  information while capturing directional information in relationships, we present
  a directed hypergraph spatial convolution framework that is designed to acquire
  vertex embeddings of directed hypergraphs. The framework characterizes the information
  propagation of directed hypergraphs through two stages: hyperedge information aggregation
  and hyperedge information broadcasting. During the hyperedge information aggregation
  stage, we optimize the acquisition of hyperedge information using attention mechanisms.
  In the hyperedge information broadcasting stage, we leverage a directed hypergraph
  momentum encoder to capture the directional information of directed hyperedges.
  Experimental results on five publicly available directed graph datasets of three
  different categories demonstrate that our proposed DHMConv outperforms various commonly
  used graph and hypergraph models. "
