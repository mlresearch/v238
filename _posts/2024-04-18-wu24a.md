title: " Learning Granger Causality from Instance-wise Self-attentive Hawkes Processes "
software: " https://github.com/DongxiaW/InstanceWise_SelfAttentive_Hawkes_Processes "
abstract: " We address the problem of learning Granger causality from asynchronous,
  interdependent, multi-type event sequences. In particular, we are interested in
  discovering instance-level causal structures in an unsupervised manner. Instance-level
  causality identifies causal relationships among individual events, providing more
  fine-grained information for decision-making. Existing work in the literature either
  requires strong assumptions, such as linearity in the intensity function, or heuristically
  defined model parameters that do not necessarily meet the requirements of Granger
  causality. We propose Instance-wise Self-Attentive Hawkes Processes (ISAHP), a novel
  deep learning framework that can directly infer the Granger causality at the event
  instance level. ISAHP is the first neural point process model that meets the requirements
  of Granger causality. It leverages the self-attention mechanism of the transformer
  to align with the principles of Granger causality. We empirically demonstrate that
  ISAHP is capable of discovering complex instance-level causal structures that cannot
  be handled by classical models. We also show that ISAHP achieves state-of-the-art
  performance in proxy tasks involving type-level causal discovery and instance-level
  event type prediction. "
